Foals in winter coats, white girls of the north
File past one, five and one
They are the fabled lambs of Sunday ham, the E.H.S. norm

And they could float above the grass in circles if they tried
A latent power I know they hide
To keep some hope alive that a girl like I could ever try
Could ever try

So we just skirt the hallway sides
A phantom and a fly
Follow the lines and wonder why
There's no connection

A week of rolling eyes and cheap shots from the trite
And we're off to Nemarca's porch again
Another afternoon with the goat head tunes and pilfered booze

We wandered through her mama's house and the milk from the window lights
Family portraits circa '95
This is that foreign land with the sprayed on tans (Ah)
And it all feels fine, be it silk or slime

So when they tap our Monday heads, to zombie walk in our stead
This town seems hardly worth the time
And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme, too far along in our climb
Stepping over what now towers to the sky
With no connection

Ooh, whoa
Ooh, whoa
Ooh, whoa

So when they tap my Sunday heads, to zombie walk in our stead
This town seems hardly worth the time
And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme, too far along in our crime
Stepping over what now towers to the sky
With no connection

Ooh, whoa whoa
Ooh, whoa whoa
Ooh, whoa whoa
Ooh, whoa whoa (Ah)
Ooh, whoa whoa (Ah)
Ooh, whoa whoa (Ah)
