I'll talk, but I know you won't listen to me
Oh you wouldn't say it, but you wanted to
Don't look, don't walk away when I am speaking
I'll take it, but I know it's not for taking

Though I may some what of what you notice me (?)
I told you do not follow what you couldn't see
Oh I love you
I love you

Some way you will want it your way, sunrise
So I would not be the stake in what I know is right
Don't be so funny with me, I'm not laughing
Oh I love you
I love you
