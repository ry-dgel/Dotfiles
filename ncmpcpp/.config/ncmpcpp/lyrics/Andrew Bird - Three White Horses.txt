There'll be three white horses
All in a line
There'll be three white horses in a line

Three white horses
When you go that way
You will need somebody when you come to die

Don't dismiss it like it's easy
Tell me what's so easy
About coming to say goodbye

You're gonna miss her in the evening
You know all you need is
Somebody when you come to die

There'll be three white horses in a line
There'll be three white horses in a line
There'll be three white horses
When you go that way
You will need somebody when you come to die

It's not desperation I've been breeding
It's just a need we're feeding
Before we say goodbye

You're gonna miss me in the evening
You know all you need is
Somebody when you come to die
Yeah we'll all be needing
Somebody when you come to die
