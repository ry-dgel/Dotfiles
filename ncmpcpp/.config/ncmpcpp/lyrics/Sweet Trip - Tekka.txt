[Hook - Dimitri McDowell:] 
I feel thorns where my crown was
I’ll be weak but I’m alive
From the dust until dawn yeah
I’ll survive cause I got
Sweet Victory
Nobody can take it from me
Sweet victory
Cause I got, sweet victory yeah

[Verse 1:]
You see me limping , I know you see me limping
You can’t tell on these CDs, but bro I’m knee deep in it
I’m wading in my weakness, he made me dependent
I’d be lying through my teeth to say I don’t resent it
Even as I write these lines I’m close to tears
My body ain’t been working right for seven years
So miss me with that “keep your chin up try to smile”
Bruh I’m twenty-six, I should feel better by a mile
Keep all your anecdotes and cute quotes
I’ll pass on clichés for true hopes, he’s too dope

[Hook]

[Bridge - Trip Lee & Dimitri McDowell:] 
Toast to the King, cheers to the ceiling
Feeling good we gon’ to make it to the finish
Sweet victory
You hear me, holla if you feel me
We still running even though we limping
Sweet victory
Cause we winning, yeah you know we winning
Even though we winded we still in it
Sweet victory
Cause we winning, yeah you know we winning, now we live in
Sweet victory

[Verse 2:]
They see me on the stage, they like “that boy the man”
They hit play on them songs, they clapping in them stands
They like, “I bet you got a lot of them stacks in rubber bands”
So when I say its been a hard few years they think I’m playing
But you don’t know my life boy, you don’t know my life boy
You don’t know what its been like on my wife
Don’t know my fight boy
Been in them trenches steady trying to fight my foes
And when I couldn’t fight no more He brought me low low
He brought me low, I know I can’t bear that load

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3:]
They like “I hear you talking wins but I see your losses”
“You celebrating crowns but I see your crosses”
Thats the paradox that don’t fit in your merry box
You might not understand ‘till you walk in this pair of socks
The victor ain’t the one thats winning seventh inning
Trophies don’t go to the ones that got a good beginning
When I say I win I don’t mean this day I’m in
I mean that day when the grey skies fade out then
I’m winning ‘cause I reign with him

[Outro - Leah Smith:]
The crown of thorns declares you’re King
A scarlet robe can’t cloak your majesty
Yeah they nailed your hands, you nailed our death
From the cross you reigned
Your kingdom knows no end

Oh Jesus, you won it all
Oh Jesus, victorious [x2]
Oh Jesus
