Gabriel oh Gabriel when will we see your face again
Faded beauty velum parchment page
Oh lead me through my darkest night
Oh angel won't you hear my plight
Let your love and sorrow rain on me

And how I see the embers burn
How they tend to twist and turn
How the only light in me is dyeing out
Bringing light into my dread
All the angels cry their tears of misery

Gabriel oh Gabriel when will you free me from my hell
Words suppressed with awestruck melody
Oh lead me from my oldest fight oh memories let them all take flight
Leave me with my distant harmony

And how I see the embers burn
How they tend to twist and turn
How the only light in me is dyeing out
Bringing light into my dread
All the angels cry their tears of misery

Gabriel oh Gabriel when will you free me from my hell
Words suppressed with awestruck melody
Oh lead me from my oldest fight oh memories let them all take flight
Leave me with my distant harmony

And how I see the embers burn
How they tend to twist and turn7
How the only light in me is dyeing out
As the clouds break out ahead
Bringing light into my dread
All the angels cry tears of misery
