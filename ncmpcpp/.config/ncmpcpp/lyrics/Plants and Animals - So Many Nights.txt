It doesn't matter what I say it doesn't matter what I do
It seems I'm going to have to change my look for you cos
I've got two shoes but they've been walked too far
And I think that we could float from evening to the stars

When I see you in the distance with your friends
I look around and then I look down at my threads
It's inappropriate that I should present like a
Retired matador with unpaid rent

So many nights I'm still thinking about you
And so many nights you step in and I walk through
So he doesn't care except he still combs his hair
So what am I supposed to do?

I bought a suit and I bought a top hat
And I put a red stripe down the side of my slacks
Went to the barber got my hair cut high
And I bought a ticket for the opera tonight

But when and I see you your bodice and your pride
It's nice to greet you with an interrupted stride, besides
You say 'Good evening' you don't say 'Goodnight'
And I can't deny that

So many nights I'm still thinking about you
And so many nights until I changed my suit
And when I'm bare don't need to comb my hair
Cos I found what to do

Put your waistcoat on, put your waistcoat on

So many nights I'm still thinking about you
And so many nights you step in and I walk through
So he doesn't care except he still combs his hair
So what am I supposed to do?

So many nights I'm still thinking about you
And so many nights until I changed my suit
And when I'm bare don't need to comb my hair
Cos I found what to do

Put your waistcoat on, put your waistcoat on
Put your waistcoat on, put your waistcoat on
