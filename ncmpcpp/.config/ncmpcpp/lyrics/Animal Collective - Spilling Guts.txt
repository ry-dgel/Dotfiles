Takes some time
To waste a guy
Must be mad, OK
A smoldering burn
Must be bad, cut deep
And festering day by day

No one wants
A free-for-all
Just a chance, a break
A lift to climb
On a back, tough luck
A pebble short of quit

Only those that get into the way, way back

Way, way back
Before the thumb
Was a way, a path
A reckoning
Like a catch, sewn deep
And gesturing day by day

Take a guy
An everyman
Must be glad, well off
A gentle ease
Underneath a film
That's cracking bit by bit

Only those that get into the way, that's that
Or maybe keep in mind
Take the hit or take the fall

Fall back
Fall back
Fall back
Fall back

Fall back
Fall back
Fall back
Fall back
