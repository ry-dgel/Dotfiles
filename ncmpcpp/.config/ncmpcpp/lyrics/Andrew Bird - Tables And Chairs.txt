If we can call them friends, then we can call them on their telephones
And they won't pretend that they're too busy or they're not alone
And if we can call them friends, then we can call
Holler at 'em down these hallowed halls
Just don't let the human factor fail to be a factor at all

Don't
Don't you worry about the atmosphere
Or any sudden pressure change
'Cause I know that it's starting to get warm in here
And things are starting to get strange

And did you
Did you see how all our friends were there
And they're drinking roses from the can
And how, how I wish I, I had talked to them
And I wished they fit into the plan

And we were tired of being mild
We were so tired of being mild
And we were tired ...

I know we're gonna meet someday in the crumbled financial institutions of this land
There will be tables and chairs
There'll be pony rides and dancing bears
There'll even be a band
'Cause, listen, after the fall, there'll be no more countries, no currencies at all
We're gonna live on our wits
We're gonna throw away survival kits
Trade butterfly knives for Adderal
and that's not all
woah!
there will be snacks, there will
there will be snacks!
