Only feel a chill whenever I come out of my shell
I'd surely lie if I said that I was sure that it might work out

Now, I won't let it slide
No, I wont let it slip up

Found a way and I feel like I shouldn't let go
Drop a bomb on the spots where my doubt streams grow
What to do when the things that I want don't allow
For the handful of mouths that I'm trying to feed

Got to do what you've got to do

What weighs on my mind
So I cant get sleep at night

Say, can I make a bad mistake?
Say what it is I want to say
Say what?
