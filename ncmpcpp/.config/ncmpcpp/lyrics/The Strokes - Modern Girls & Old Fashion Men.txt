You were...
Modern girls always have to go
(Right on time)
Old-fashioned men always want a mistress
(You were right)
Modern girls always get their way 
(I was wrong)
Modern men dream of what they can't say 
(That's alright) Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? 
I don't belong (I don't belong)

Why you gotta say it if you know it's something wrong? 
(Why're you sitting over there?)
Says that he'll apologize and it won't take too long 
Well you don't wanna trust nobody else
(Always thinking 'bout yourself)

(Time)
There's a few things that are gonna have to change
(I'm your son)
Everyone has the same opinion
(Won't you please?)
Your time is almost over
(Don't be mean)
We won't get the chance to do this over 
(That's alright) Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? 
I don't belong (I don't belong)

I don't want the imprint of your key upon my nose 
(Why're you sitting over there?)
You don't have to tell no one 'cause no one wants to know 
That you don't have no happiness at all 
(Always thinking 'bout yourself)

Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down)
So fucking help me up

Always thinking 'bout yourself
(You don't love me)
Always thinking 'bout yourself
(I am an animal)
Always thinking 'bout yourself
(I am not practical)

Was I?
