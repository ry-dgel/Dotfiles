Been walking in circles so long
My head is spinning in directions gone
The night's darkest just before the dawn
So goodbye my friend, it's time to move on

Taking some time to clear out my mind
To change up your eye

Oh, why did I leave it so long?
(?)
I guess I'm saying that this alibi was wrong
Remembering is hardest when you're alone

Broken and cold, take out the man
Well, all my way to Medicine Hat
