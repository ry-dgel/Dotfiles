Come back to me in summer time
Come back to me in summer time
Come back to me before too long
Come back to me in summer time

Go back to me in summer time
Go back to me in summer time
Go back to me before too long
Go back to me in summer time

I wait a lot, I’m waiting a ton (?)
Somebody’s saying that we will fight (?)
Don’t, me and you, we’re hating your tie? (?)
Go back to me in summer time 

And I saw murdered too and hated whoever’s bullet (?)
And thought it was low, whatever power (?)
