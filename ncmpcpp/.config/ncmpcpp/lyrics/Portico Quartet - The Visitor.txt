This life
your body ends here
you had a mouthful of god's love affair
soon you 'll rise above your tower
to a steepless state of calm
Love is all around
you won't find the answers underground
but maybe at the end of timeSomehow your smile still stays with me
the card of judjement did call for peace
I 'll meet you in my dreams
as the fool who found his star
Life is all around
you won't find the answers to it now
but maybe at the end of time.
