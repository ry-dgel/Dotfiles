I was gazing in your eyes
Seeing butterflies melting on the wall
Strangest thing I saw
Clever little guys
Wonderful surprise

Will you come and fetch me, girl
From the brink?

I'm starting to kink
And I'm too numb to think
If this nightmare can't be stopped
Go out and find me when I'm dropped

Onto a bale of hay looking the other way
From noncoms in machines squeezing tangerines
Emitting horrid cries
Wonderful surprise

Will you come and fetch me, girl
From the brink?

I'm starting to kink
And I'm too numb to think
If this nightmare can't be stopped
Go out and find me when I'm dropped
