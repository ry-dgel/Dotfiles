Nice dreams

Sky
What would I want? Sky

Is everything alright?
You feeling moldy?
You feeling lonely?
You're not the only
Is everything alright?
You feeling stormy?
You feeling phony?
You're not the only

Do you get up up up?
Clouds stop and move above me
Too bad they can't help me
What is the right way?
Do I float up up up?
I stop and look around me,
Gray's where that color should be,
What is the right way?

Old glasses clinking and a new order's blinking
And I, I should be floating but I'm weighted by thinking
That a guide on the river,
Really can't make it change,
When the sky gets filled up too fast
And the taxi man's saying, "You better
Give me some money,
Stop daydreaming, dude!"
When the point of horizon is hiding from you,
What would you want, sky?

What would I want? Sky

Is everything alright?
You feeling lonely?
You feeling moldy?
You're not the only
Is everything alright?
You feeling stormy?
You feeling phony?
You're not the only

(Are you taking it lightly?
Lost in the flurry
You start to worry
You will be buried
Taking it lightly
And so you hurry
And then you worry
Here come those flurries)

Do you get up up up?
Clouds stop and move above me
Too bad they can't help me
What is the right way?
Do I float up up up?
When I stop and look around me,
Gray's where that color should be,
What is the right way?

(Taking it lightly?
Lost in the flurry
You start to worry
You will be buried
Taking it lightly
And so you hurry
And then you worry
Here come those flurries)

Old glasses clinking and a new order's blinking
And I, I should be floating but I'm weighted by thinking
I'm a fly on the river,
Gotta make me some change,
When the sky gets filled up too fast
And the taxi cab's waiting, you better
Give him some money,
Stop daydreaming, dude,
When the point of horizon is hiding its blues
What would you want, sky?

What would I want? Sky

"What would I want? Sky" sample taken from the track Unbroken Chain, Grateful Dead: From the Mars Hotel at 1:17:

    "Willow [sky
    Whoa, I walk] and wonder why
    They say love your brother
    But you will catch it when you try"
