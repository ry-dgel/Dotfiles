The little bell lies on the ground 
Although it tries it cannot sound 
It used to ring across the air 
Its sweetened tone would linger there 

But from a careless hand it rocked 
Its shell is only made of crock 
Although it lies there split in two 
It still tries to ring out to you 

Now deep inside my wooden clock 
There is a tick but not a tock 
Although into the room it chimes 
It only tells me half the time 

Why do you leave me so confused 
I'll miss my bus, my job I'll lose 
Oh what is wrong my wooden clock 
It breaks my heart to see you stop
