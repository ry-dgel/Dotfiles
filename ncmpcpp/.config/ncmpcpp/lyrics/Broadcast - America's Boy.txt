Quaker toil and texan oil, rockets on, we're arm in arm
NASA nude, you're manly you

Oh, american soldier, America's boy
American soldier, America's boy

Gun me down with yankee power, cock pit tom with army charm
The eagle lands army commands

Oh, american soldier, America's boy
American soldier, America's boy

Cowboy corn and bugle horn, miracle son, don't post me on
You are dean and me the queen

Oh, american soldier, America's boy
American soldier, America's boy
Oh, american soldier, America's boy
American soldier, America's boy
America's boy, America's boy
