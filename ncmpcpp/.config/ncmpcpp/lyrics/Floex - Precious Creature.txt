Against the gentle grain my fingers strain
Distorted faces take the siderooms
It's like I'm paralyzed when you're the one that's true
Who could you be?

Can I be there in my time
I'll be dead in my time
And if I catch the fire that comes
First I'll wait for your connection

If I could calm that fire
And scratch your namesake on
You precious creature
Workin' walkin' workin' walkin' song
Walkin' workin' quest against my heart
Just when I tried to walk the way I found
I'm just speechless
We could be so harmless now

If I could calm that fire
And stretch its soul for miles
You wanna be faceless, I've tried
To work it out

Walkin' talkin' quest against my heart
In front of you I've spent all of my art
With you
And our colored wounds
