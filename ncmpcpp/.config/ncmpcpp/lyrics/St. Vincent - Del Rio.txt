We were down on 10th
You told me I looked spent
Gave that look you give
And rushed me to the river
Del Del Rio
Del Del Rio

We filled our cups
Drank to drink enough
Then when we were done
We threw ourselves in the river
Del Del Rio
Del Del Rio

Getting some strange looks
Back from the shore
And you, you pinched my arm
Said look who's lucky now
And you, you saved my life
Too many times to count
Del Del Rio
Del Del Rio
