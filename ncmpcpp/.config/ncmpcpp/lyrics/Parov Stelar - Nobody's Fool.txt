You used me up
Without turning a hair
I tried to escape
Just to find myself caught up in the same old game

Oh yeah

You kept me in emotional strain
You gave me nothing but heartache and pain
For five years I hoped against hope

Oh yeah

Five years I hoped against hope

Oh yeah

I cried for you
And I died for you
No longer I'm gonna be your fool

But now's the time
I'm through with you
Nothing is all but certain but it's true

I'll be over you
Over you
Over you
I'll be over you
Over you
Over you

Oh ain't nobody's fool

And I know there must have been some kind of sorrow
So you entrapped yourself inside a bottle
And I proved to you my love so true
No longer am I gonna be your fool

You may be sure
I won't make it through without you
But the one I leave behind is you

I stuck by you
Did everything I do
No longer I'm gonna be no fool

You may be sure
I won't make it through
The one I leave behind is you

I'll be over you
Over you

Ain't nobody's fool
