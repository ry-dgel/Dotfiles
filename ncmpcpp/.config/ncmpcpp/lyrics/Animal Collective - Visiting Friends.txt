We were visiting friends and saying hello
Then getting stoned and not saying much
Watching the people on TV who talk faster than us
I'm still holding the cup ignoring the sound of the ice cream truck
She had visiting moods, what it wants to be
We were visiting friends, wanted words too muddy

[?] got stuck, I walked a [?]

I heard a bird in the windowpane, you rolled up your grass
[?] but the cop couldn't tell, [?] visiting his, we're visiting [?]
Marking the difference in the way that they smell
The light hits them differently, the sheets do get cold
The windows are cracked, do you recognize the room
The posters that tilt, furniture spread around, we were visiting mine
We were visiting mine, we were visiting mine
We were visiting mine, we were visiting mine
