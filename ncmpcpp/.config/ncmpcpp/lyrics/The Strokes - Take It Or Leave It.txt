I'm in control

Boys act too tough
Enough is enough
Well, on the minds of other men

I said just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it

Oh, that's right

Oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends if he can and
He's gonna win someday

I'm not like that
Boys lie too much
Girls act too tough

And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it

Oh, that's right

Oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends if he can and
He's gonna win someday
Oh, he will
