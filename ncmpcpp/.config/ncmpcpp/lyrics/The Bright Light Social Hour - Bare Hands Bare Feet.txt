Let's build a city
Bare hands bare feet
Pick a place on a hill
Choose a spot on a beach
It's all within reach
Let's start it
The tallest trees out front
A chicken coop in the back
Nobody's needs in lack
Let's start it
I'll wind power my hips
We'll solar power our souls
Now we're on a roll
Let's start it
A feast every night
A festival every week
If this is what you seek
Come on!
Muévete güerita
Ponte a bailar
Ponte a trabajar
Let's start it
Mueve el culito
Quítate el vestido
Todos somos amigos
Let's start it
Cerveza fría in one hand
Hammer in the other
Get started with your brother
Let's start it
Hey Curtis
Hey what?
Hey A.J.
Hey what?
Hey Jo
Hey what?
Let's build a city
Bare hands bare feet
