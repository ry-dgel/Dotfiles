Take your apples from the earth
And your fingerlings from the air
If you cried when you were born
Cause it ain't fair

You got nothing
Nothing that you wear
And there's a drink that we're all needing
I need to weep but we have tried
And though the clouds they keep on seeding
Still the county remains dry
The county remains dry
The county remains dry

I see your coat that it needs sewing
And these seeds will sow the corn sill prize
But in your absence nothingâ€™s growing
And still the country remains dry
The county remains dry
The county remains dry
The county remains dry

But still we keep on dreaming
Of that fifty year flood
Of oceans of plasma
And rivers of blood

Taking apples from the earth
And your fingerlings from the air
If you cried when you were born
Cause it ain't fair
You've got nothing
Nothing to wear
