I wrote your name upon the back of my hands 
Slept upon it and I woke up with it 
Backwards on my face 
Reading forwards to my mirror 
To my heart 

Twilight omens in my life 
Then I hear your name 
Hear the way you sing your name, baby 
Should I give you a call 
And I say: 
Baby, you still feel the same. 

I typed your number into my calculator 
Where it's spelled as your word 
When you turn it upside down 
You can turn my dirty world 
The bright way round 

Twilight omens in my life 
Then I hear your name 
Hear the way you sing your name 
Should give you a call 
And I say: 
Oh, maybe I still feel the same. 
Twilight omens in my life 
Keep hearing your name 
Keep hearing your name 
Keep hearing your name 
Keep hearing you sing your name
