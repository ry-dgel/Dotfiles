I can breed like, no friend of mine
o friend of mine is asking for forgotten time
p in silence like some violent vine
         
           That's wrapped itself around my neck
It's growing fine

A type of new disease
I will break the chain, the train is moving faster
As it seems to run away
I will follow and pass great plains
Fields of fields of precious, precious people passing grain

There've been times when, I've slipped and fell
I hit my head hard and the blood it did spill
But your big hands helped to lift me up again
And once on my feet
You sent me back to myself
