Come and see, the morning's here
The turn stone sleeps on the rusty pier
And it's only time but it's a new year
If only I knew why but I'm still here with you

Things will be much better
Come April or May
Time can be so cruel
But it'll be my friend someday

There was a lot we didn't say
Wasn't there, Josephine
There were oceans in our way
But what does that even mean?

The fateful damn goodbye
As the trains pull in and out
The ruthlessness of time
The rain, the end

Only we will laugh about
Skinnyless big brown shoes
If you sleep too long
The world might wake up without you
