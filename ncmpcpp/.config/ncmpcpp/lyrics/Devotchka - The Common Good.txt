We are only speaking from our conscience
He's gonna take us when he wants us
We only need a little piece
Somewheres in style is somewhere out of reach

If this is love, I'm gonna lose, there is no doubt
You're gonna chew me up and spit me out
Oh, isn't it fun?
Isn't it funny?

A little faith, a little money
You shouldn't laugh, this isn't funny
We're gonna give back what we steal
Just say the word and I shall be healed

If I love you, I'm gonna lose, there is no doubt
You're gonna chew me up and spit me out
If I love you, I'm gonna lose, there is no doubt
Go ahead and chew me up and spit me out
