From under night sky we will wait hoping
That our reflection meets between two
Below the dark cries secretly laughing
A smile was passed but never on you

Come into the meaning when the light sold our
Secrets left us in turn
Circle in the desert where the mind grows now
In a sand dance we burn

Upon a question answers prevail
A vivid memory of which shes unsure
A lesser meaning left among feelings
A pirouette left down on the ground

Come into the meaning when the light sold our
Secrets left us in turn
Circle in the desert where the mind grows now
In a sand dance we burn

Guide the light to
Sinking from view
We have to be

What we have to learn
We have to see
Things that we wish could be

Flames between you
Burning from view
We have to be
What we have to learn
We have to see
Things that we wish could be

Still under night sky
We will wait hoping
That our reflection meets between two
Below the dark cries
Secret in passing
A smile will last but never on you

Guide the light to
Sinking from view
We have to be
What we have to learn
We have to see
Things that we wish could be

Flames between you
Burning from view
We have to be
What we have to learn
We have to see
Things that we wish could be
