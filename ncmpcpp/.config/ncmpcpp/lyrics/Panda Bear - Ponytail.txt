When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
I get so hungry and I wish it never

Never would, never would
Never would, never would
Never would
Never would stop growing

When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
I get get so full and I wish it never

Never would, never would
Never would, never would
Never would
Never would stop growing

When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
I am as I want to be and I know I never

Never will, never will
Never will, never will
Never will stop caring
