This house is sad
Because he's not
Inside it

Where does he hide
When someone comes
To the front door?

There's no one, there's no one, there's no one, no one
There's no one, there's no one, there's no one, no one
There's no one, there's no one, there's no one, no one
There's no one, no one, there's no one to say meow (Kitties)

Meow (Kitties, kitties)
Meow (Kitties)
Meow
Meow
