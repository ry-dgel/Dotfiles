Goodbye weekend, so long darling
Macky's been a bad, bad, boy.
and what they're preaching is sure to change me
Should rearrange me or so they thought

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well honey that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

Suddenly, place me, give me a sign
Repeat the mantra when you're stepping out of line
Give me your number, something to be..
May help out the country boy but it won't work out on me

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well honey that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well honey that's fine just know that you're wasting your time
