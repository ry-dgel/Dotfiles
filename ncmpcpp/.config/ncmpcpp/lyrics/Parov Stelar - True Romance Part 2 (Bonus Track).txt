I think that you know that I'm for sure beware of you
And I know that it's hard to belive in yourself.

And this time I got you know me better.
And I'm yours in any matter.
And this time I got you know me better.
That no one else can feel me deeper,
But I know that it's hard to belive in yourself.

With you starting a new life of happiness.
You brought up the enemy myself.
Yes you are the one I love,
The one I know and never leave.
