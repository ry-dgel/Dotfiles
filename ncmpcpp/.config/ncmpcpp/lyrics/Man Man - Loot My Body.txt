Have you learned nothing at all?
When the curtain comes crashing down
Will it miss ya, will it crush ya
Will you bend like a little bitch under pressure?

Will your friends come along and say
I knew him before he was a puddle
In hindsight I dig him this way
In this format
As a puddle

Feel free to loot my body
(Just take whatever you want)
Feel free to loot my body
(Just take whatever you need)
Feel free to loot my body
(Just take whatever you want)
But please
Don't start a band

Post apocalyptic babe
Will you be my
Post apocalyptic babe
Will you be the light?
(No)

Have you learned nothing at all?
When the city comes crashing down
Will it miss ya, will it crush ya
Will you shatter like a fissure under pressure?

Will your friends come along and say
Well I knew him before he was trouble
In the big scope better this way
It's a fine choice life as a puddle

Feel free to loot my body
(Just take whatever you want)
Feel free to loot my body
(Just take whatever you need)
Feel free to loot my body
(Just take whatever you want)
But please
Don't start a band

Feel free to loot my body
Feel free to loot my body
Feel free to loot my body
Feel free to loot my body
Feel free to loot my body
Feel free to loot my body
Feel free to loot my body
Feel free to loot it all

Have you learned nothing at all?
When the curtain comes crashing down
Will it miss ya, will it crush ya
Will you bend like a little bitch under pressure
Will your friends come along and say:
Well I knew him before he was a puddle
In hindsight I dig him this way
