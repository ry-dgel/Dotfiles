When everybody is running in the big race
And having a good time
Who am I to cast a shadow?
Who am I?

I looked Death in the face last night
I saw him in a mirror
And he simply smiled
He told me not to worry
He told me just to take my time

We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream
And another year has come and gone
We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream

And if you come to me
And if you touch my hand
I might just slip away
I might just disappearâ€”who am I

And if you think I'm worth it
And if you think it's not too late
We might start falling
If we don't try too hard
We might start falling in love

We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream
And another year has come and gone
We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream

We're on a healing path
We're on a rollercoaster ride
That can never turn back
And if you love me
And if you really try
To make the seconds count
And we can close our eyes

We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes
And another year has come and gone
We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream

We close our eyes and the world has turned around again
