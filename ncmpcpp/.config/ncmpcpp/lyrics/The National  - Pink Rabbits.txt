I couldn't find quiet
I went out in the rain
I was just soaking my head
To unrattle my brain

Somebody said
"You disappeared in a crowd."
I didn't understand then
I don't understand now

Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits?

And everybody was gone
You were staring down the street
Because you were trying not to crack up

It wasn't like a rain
It was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain
It just came over me

And I love a storm
But I don't love lightning
All the waters coming up so fast
It's frightening

Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits?

And everybody was gone
I was staring down the street
Because I was trying not to crack

I was solid gold
I was in the fight
I was coming back
From what seemed like a ruin

I couldn't see
You coming so far
I just turn around
And there you are

I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground

You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart

You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart

And everybody was gone
You were staring down the street
Because you were trying not to crack up

Bona Drag was still on
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out

You said it would be painless
A needle in a doll
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all

You said it would be painless
A needle in a doll
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all (when the sound kicks out)

You said it would be painless
A needle in a doll (when the sound kicks out)
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all
