Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo doo

Walk, little walk, small talk, big thoughts
Gonna tell 'em all just what I want
That street, two streets, I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings

Count high low, don't worry, my eyes are closed
I'm the Superman and it's my show
One shoe, two, gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm gonna kick until I need new shoes

Yeah, yeah
I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things

Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo doo 
(These are one of those times when we're gonna have a lot of fun)

I run, they run, everybody run run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride, boat ride, piggyback a-ride
I'm going to show them all how I can ride

One two three, close your eyes and count to four
I'm gonna hide behind my bedroom door
Crayons on walls, I'll color on 'em all
Draw until I've broken every law

Yeah, yeah
I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop

I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop

Ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ah, ha ha ha
Ahh
