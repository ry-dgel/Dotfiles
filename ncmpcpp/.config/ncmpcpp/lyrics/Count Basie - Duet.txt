Goin' to Chicago, sorry but I can't take you.
Goin' to Chicago, baby, but I just can't take you.
There ain't nothin' in Chicago that a monkey woman like you can do.

When you see me comin' baby, raise your window high.
When you see me comin' baby, raise your window high.
And when I pass by, baby, hang your head down and cry.

You're losin' a good man, baby, I've done so much for you.
You're losin' a good man, baby, I've done so much for you.
But thats all over, there's no more that I'm going to do.

Look out Chicago, here I come.

There's no need to cry, baby, I won't be back no more.
There ain't no need to cry, mama, 'cause your daddy won't be back no more.
You made me feel so lonely.  I'm walking right out that door.

Good bye bye baby.  I hope you make it alright.
Good bye bye baby I hope you make it alright.
I know you're going to miss me, girl, when it's cold at night.

I won't be back no more baby.  It's all over now.
I won't be back no more baby.  It's all over now.
Goodbye baby.  I hope you make it somehow.

Look out Chicago, here I come.  Yeah.
