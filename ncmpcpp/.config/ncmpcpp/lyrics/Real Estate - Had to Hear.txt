I'm out again on my own
A reflection in the chrome
Of an adding machine
It's been so long
My mind is drawing a blank
Don't know if I can go back
But to live out this dream
It's just my luck
I call you up 

I had to hear you just to feel near you
I know it's not true
But it's been so long 
I know it's wrong
I know

I don't need the horizon to tell me where the sky ends
It's a subtle landscape where I call from
I'm out again on my own
A refelction in the chrome
Of an adding machine
It's been so long
I call you up

I had to hear you just to feel near you
I know it's not true 
But it's been so long 
I know it's wrong
I know
