I need the ground when I shake my brain I must have felt the sound
You were travelling on, following Zond
Four deep tonight in sixty-five we were left for God
Tell me what went wrong, what was Zond?

When I found the ghost, it's meaning after all
Im gonna tell you what I saw, and where it came from
Well, when I'm 'round the door, when I'm 'round the (?) back down
Leave it all where we started this song, a song about Zond
Cross my heart, universe, go black on me
After all I've seen, in a waking dream
Weâ€™re from the darkness in between

Something about Julie or Judy, I wanna love me Julie, gonna do me Julie
But the light and the sun and the moon and sound, a merry-go round
And I misbehave, well, I keep awaiting, trying to meditate
When I'm on my round, ooh, you gotta get sound

Now I'm like the dog on a satellite
And I'm flying high and it must be found
When I'm 'round the door (?) back down
And it all really-really is Zond, a song about Zond
Cross my heart, universe, go black on me
After all I've seen, in a waking dream
I'm from the darkness in between
