I wasn't willing
To fight on the floor
Throwing the chairs
Through the door

I wasn't willing
To fight on the floor
Something to say to the poor

The storms in July
Took off the trees
Took off the place to be
The animals died
Once in a while
Once in a while

I wasn't willing
To make up the bed
Folding the sheets to your half
I wasnt willing
To say it again
Waiting for things to begin

The storms in July
Took off the trees
Took off the place to be
The animals died
Once in a while
Once in a while

La la la
La la la...
