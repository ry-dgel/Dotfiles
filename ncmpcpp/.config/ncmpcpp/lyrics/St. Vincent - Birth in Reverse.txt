Oh what an ordinary day
Take out the garbage, masturbate
I'm still holding for the laugh
The dogs will bark, so let them bark
The birds will cry, I'll let them cry
Here's my report from the edge

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm sane
In phenomenal lies
I'm the cause; make a turn
Near the party line
there was a birth in reverse
In America

This too will haunt me through the war
Laugh all you want, but I want more
'Cause what I'm swearing, I never sworn before

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm sane
In phenomenal lies
I'm the cause; make a turn
Near the party line
Like a birth in reverse
In America

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm sane
In phenomenal lies
I'm the cause; make a turn
Near the party line
there was a birth in reverse
In America
