Rollerskates, them lines
Hot sun and clear blue skies
The waves are crashing by
And when she passed me by
And gave a wink and smile
And I was on cloud nine
Lord

The way you move your hips
And lick your lips
The way you dip
You got me up so high (hey-ey)
And girl you got that body
With them curves like a Bugatti
I just wanna drive, oh

And girl you know
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh

And gravity defied
I can't believe my eyes
That thing can bring the tides, hey
And round and round clockwise
Like come here, go ride
I wanna go all night, yes

The way you move your hips
And lick your lips
The way you dip
You got me up so high, yeah (hey-ey)
And girl you got that body
With them curves like a Bugatti
I just wanna drive, oh

And girl you know
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh

Yeah
Oh oh
Yeah

Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh

Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh oh
