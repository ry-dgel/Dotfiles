Men :
Born of cold and winter air
and mountain rain combining.
This icy force both foul and fair
has a frozen heart worth mining.
So cut through the heart, cold and clear.
Strike for love and strike for fear.
See the beauty, sharp and sheer
Split the ice apart
And break the frozen heart
Hup! Ho!
Watch your step!
Let it go!
Hup! Ho!
Watch your step!
Let it go!
Man 1:
Beautiful!
Man 2 :
Powerful!
Man 3:
Dangerous!
Man 1 :
Cold!
Ice has a magic,
can't be controlled.
Stronger than one, stronger than ten,
stronger than a hundred men! Ho!
Born of cold and winter air
and mountain rain combining.
This icy force both foul and fair
has a frozen heart worth mining.
Cut through the heart, cold and clear.
Strike for love and strike for fear.
There's beauty and there's danger here
Split the ice apart
Beware the frozen heart...
