When Lenin was little
All the birds in the forest were singin' "Man, this is it!"
But now that he's older
All the sailors in Heaven are screamin' "Abandon Ship!"

I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I said
In my head

When Lenin was little
Dressed up like a vampire on All-Hallow's Eve
All the saints up in Heaven
Were look down at the leaves fallin' from the trees

I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I said

Daddy, Daddy, please spare the world from the government
Daddy, Daddy, please spare my soul from my own judgment
Daddy, Daddy, please send me a heart that isn't made of cement
'Cause the money's all been spent
The money's all been spent 

Daddy, Daddy, please spare the world from the government
Daddy, Daddy, please spare my soul from my own judgment
Daddy, Daddy, please send me a heart that isn't made of cement
'Cause the money's all been spent
The money's all been spent 
The money's all been spent 
The money's all been spent
