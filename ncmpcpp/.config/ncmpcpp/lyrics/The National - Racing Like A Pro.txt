You're pink, you're young, you're middle class
They say it doesn't matter
Fifteen blue shirts and womanly hands
You're shooting up the ladder

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my God, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my God, it was a million years ago

Sometimes you get up and bake a cake or something
Sometimes you stay in bed
Sometimes you go la-di-da-di-da-di-da-da
Until your eyes roll back into your head

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my God, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my God, it was a million years ago

You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my God, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my God, it was a million years ago

You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
