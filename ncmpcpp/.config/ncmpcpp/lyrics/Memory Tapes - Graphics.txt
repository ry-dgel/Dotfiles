I'll be your lover
I'll be your friend
I'll be a part of the illusion
that let you on
and took you away
but I'm forgetting all
the lies
All that you want
is to scream at the wall
It's not the same thing
but I can't wait anymore

I don't even recognize
the sound of your voice
feel of your touch
You can be alone
even though I'm here by your side
