If I was a different man,
If I had blood in my eyes
I could have read of your heart
I could have read of your mind
But now I'm lonely as that
I put up a fight
So pick up your battering ram
Love, I wanna see it

There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that anyway

And maybe I talk too fast
Maybe I talk too much
Give me the sensitive laugh
Or give me the sensitive touch
Even if I could have kissed
Even if I couldn't apply
I'm so sorry I tried 
Love, I wanna see it

There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that anyway

(Love love love love)

There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that anyway

(Nanana Na Na Na Na)

There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that 
There's too much riding on that

There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that 
There's too much riding on that

There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
