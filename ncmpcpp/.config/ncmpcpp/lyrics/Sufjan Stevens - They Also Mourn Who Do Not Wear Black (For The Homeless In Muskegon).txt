If you happen to be educated
Time it marches on, oh time it marches on
If the end there is a sacred show
Delivers every song, delivers every song

Mourning steps and mourning gallivants
And mourning never shows, no mourning never slows
If the avatar reminds that it
Will never stand at all, will never stand as tall

Since the water made it most to sail it
Made it most to song, it made it most to song 
For the politics are not political
For what they stand, for not what they demand

Every senator and diplomat
Combines her certain part, a matter for the heart
Save yourself from recognition
Selfless and quite song, to better get along

We love you
We chose to
We made to
We love you

If we concentrate and pull resources
To the highest poll, to beat the highest pull, too
Ever will we conquer grief and find it faster
To resolve the dead, to be absolved and fed, to restore
If the advantageous reprimand misgivings
We won't grow, we will not ever know, we will not

If the advantageous reprimand misgivings (Lift my life in healthy places, lift my life in healthy places)
We won't grow, we will not ever know (Lift my life in healthy places, lift my life in healthy places)
We will not ever know,  we will not ever know, we will not (Lift my life in healthy places, lift my life in healthy places)
