Woke up feeling like "it puts the lotion in the basket"
Can you even recall the times?
Before your pheromones 
Took your common sense hostage and left you in the rain to dry?

And if you'd ever even gotten everything that you wanted?
Well wouldn't that be some king shit?

But as the case would have it
Well, you certainly haven't
You've been hand-to-mouthing every step of it

All the old timers in the neighborhood swear 
That you're cursed with a face people hate
But every single one of them's an endless variation of 
Popeye raised on lead paint

And all the woulda coulda shoulda 
Didn't cause my buddy's over
Get to it when this here is done

Repeated time and time again 
It grows into a second skin 
I can't believe that there even could be

A secret life between your eyes that I don't seem to see
Are you satisfied with waiting here for heaven forever?

A secret life between your eyes that I don't seem to see
Are you satisfied with waiting here for heaven forever?

Waiting for your schemes only weakens at the seams
All the scenes that you've spun in the dark
And who wants weak desires waiting for them in the wings
After years of leathering your scars

And all the woulda coulda shoulda 
Didn't cause my buddy's over 
Get to it when this here is done

Repeated time and time again 
It grows into a second skin 
I can't believe that there even could be

A secret life between your eyes that I don't seem to see
Are you satisfied with waiting here for heaven forever?

A secret life between your eyes that I don't seem to see
Are you satisfied with waiting here for heaven forever?

A secret life between your eyes that I don't seem to see
Are you satisfied with waiting here for heaven forever?

A secret life between your eyes that I don't seem to see
Are you satisfied with waiting here for heaven forever?
