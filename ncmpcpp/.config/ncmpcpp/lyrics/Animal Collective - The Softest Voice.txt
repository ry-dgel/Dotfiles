I feel alright, I found a place that fits tight, it feels small
But I won't get sad about it, the softest voice said to me
All through last night, I forget but I wont feel bad about it
I'll stay inside and find a page that sounds right
Bombs outside, such small birds laughing at me

Be me, be mine, I might have not have reminded
You to feel (mine to feel)
Be me, be mine, I might have not have reminded
You to feel (mine to feel)

I feel alright, I found a face that fits tight, it feels small
But I won't get sad about it
