We can't lose touch but we can let go
Blue and white gun made from Lego
All the vowels vow to hold your name
Keep your estate clean of me

I've pillowed you so many times this week
Close eyes, open, close again
Forget to fall asleep
The dark seeks dark, the dark seeks dark

Darker, darker

The nights of all my youth
Pressed into one glass of water
Scattered truths
Bewildered beast boohoos

We have our weight
Ten thousand ladybirds
All the vowels vow to guard your name
Keep your estate clean, happy

Some things lie too deep for tears to well
Close eyes open, close again
Feel as my body spells
Dark seeks dark, dark seeks dark

Darker, darker

The shadow burns across
Like embers tide paper
Darker, darker
Darker, darker
