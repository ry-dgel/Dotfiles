Mine I want, mine I want
Mine I want, mine I want
Mine I want, mine I want
Mine I want, mine I want
Mine I want

I caught you when your line got disconnected trouble
Respect the hive, it seems like days since you ejected
Your mom and I will dance you through your bad weather
Young love is fine, just please respect the candles as they line
Now son, now son, now son, now son

Mine I want, mine I want
Mine I want, mine I
Won't waste mine, won't waste my time
Won't waste mine, won't waste my time

I know there will be times, you wonder why it can't stay simple
Your mom and I to pet your head and dress your lettuce
Don't work all night and split your hair and sleep on numbers
Young love is bright, just please respect the candles in a line
Now son, now son, now son, now son
