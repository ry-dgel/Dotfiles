Running down the highway like a psychopath
All the flames and fury honey at my back
Wanna make a bet whether I make it back cause 
I'm on the edge of a heart attack

You said, "Honey quit you're worrying. Distance is 
exactly like a blowing wind. Putting out the embers 
and the tiny flames and keeping the big ones 
burning."

So I am standing in the sand where we said "it's 
the best day of my life" and meant all of it

Keep me in your soft sights,
when all of the rest have moved on
And I'll keep you in my soft sights,
when all of the crowd has gone home

Keep me in your soft sights,
when all of the rest have moved on
And I'll keep you in my soft sights,
when all of the crowd has gone home
