Wish I could say you're not the one
My heart hangs on, you're having fun
We can't be lovers and we can't be friends
But I still want you and I can't pretend
It fuckin' kills me that we're done (that we're done)

A little twist of the knife, yeah
A little salt in the cut, yeah
A little thorn in the side and it stings like hell

Feels so 

Cruel
The way you treat me like a stranger 
Cruel
When you're looking like that, oh oh
Cruel
The way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer and turn it into winter

Cruel
The way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel
When you know me like that, oh oh
Cruel
The way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer and turn it into winter

I'm makin' out like I don't care
But in her sleep I'd cut her hair
We can't be lovers and we can't be friends
But I still want you and I can't pretend
The way it hurts it's just not fair

A little twist of the knife, yeah
A little salt in the cut, yeah
A little thorn in the side and it stings like hell

Feels so 

Cruel
The way you treat me like a stranger 
Cruel
When you're looking like that, oh oh
Cruel
The way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer and turn it into winter

Cruel
The way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel 
When you know me like that, oh oh
Cruel
The way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer and turn it into winter

Once upon a time I thought that we were going strong
What we had would never move
No, it would never fall down
(No, I've never been so wrong
No, I've never been so wrong)
Once upon a time I used to dream I'd be your wife
I could hear the bells were ringing, I was dressed in white
No, I've never been so wrong
No, I've never been so wrong

A little twist of the knife

Cruel
The way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel
When you're looking like that, oh oh
Cruel
The way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer and turn it into winter

Cruel
The way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel 
When you know me like that, oh oh
Cruel
The way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer and turn it into winter

Cruel
The way you treat me like a stranger
Cruel
When you're looking like that, oh, oh
Cruel
The way you touch her when you kiss her
Take my endless summer and turn it into winter

You're so cruel
