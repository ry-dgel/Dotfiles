I can see you there
Oh, in the snowbank
With a snowman at your side
In my heart and in my spirit I concede
The things you want in life you have to really need
This is a matter of life

Only parents cry
Oh, when they want to 
Show the world they're still alive
And in my heart and in my spirit I believe
The draft beneath the doorframe comes to challenge me
This is a matter of life 

Oh, be kind to me
Oh, Benjamin who
Keeps his hands inside his sleeves
And in my heart and in my spirit I can read
The way he brushed his beard against the cedar tree
Keeping his eyes upon me

I can see you there
Oh, in the snowbank
With a snowman at your side
And in my heart and in my spirit I can see
The things you want in life you have to really need
