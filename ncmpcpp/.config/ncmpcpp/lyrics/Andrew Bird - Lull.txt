being alone it can be quite romantic
like Jacques Cousteau underneath the Atlantic
a fantastic voyage to parts unknown
going to depths where the sun's never shone
and I fascinate myself when I'm alone

so I go a little overboard but hang on to the hull
while I'm airbrushing fantasy art on a life
that's really kind of dull
oh, I'm in a lull

I'm all for moderation but sometimes it seems
moderation itself can be a kind of extreme
so I joined the congregation
I joined the softball team
I went in for my confirmation
where incense looks like steam
I start conjugating proverbs
where once there were nouns
this whole damn rhyme scheme's starting to get me down

Oh, I'm in a lull
I'm in a lull

being alone it can be quite romantic
like jacques cousteau underneath the atlantic
a fantastic voyage to parts unknown
going to depths where the sun's never shone
and I fascinate myself when I'm alone

I'm rambling on rather self consciously
while I'm stirring these condiments into my tea
and I think I'm so lame
I bet I think this song's about me
don't I don't I don't I?

I'm in a lull
