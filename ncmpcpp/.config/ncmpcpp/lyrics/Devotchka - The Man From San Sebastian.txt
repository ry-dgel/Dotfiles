Oh, it's never too late
To co-conspire, commiserate
All it takes is a little bit of love
And an awful lot of hate

Is it real?
Does it exist
I know it's wrong
But who am I to resist

All I want is one more time
Some of yours and some of mine

I don't want to spoil the fun
But am I the only one
Who sees what's going on?
Am I the only one
Who remembers the man from San Sebastian?

It's just a few more miles
I'll make it smooth and worth your while
Ah, don't look so nervous man
We're just here to lend a hand

I don't want to spoil the fun
But am I the only one
Who sees what's going on?
Am I the only one
Who remembers the man from San Sebastian?

Am I the only one
Am I the only one
Am I the only one
Who remember the man from San Sebastian?

From San Sebastian
From San Sebastian
Am I the only one
Am I the only one
San Sebastian

Am I the only one
Am I the only one
Am I the only one
Who remember the man from San Sebastian?

From San Sebastian
From San Sebastian
