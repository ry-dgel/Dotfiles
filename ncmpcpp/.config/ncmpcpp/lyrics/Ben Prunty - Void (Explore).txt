Never thought I’d be the one to love you
Never thought you’d be the one to bring me down
Where am I now?

Never thought I’d be the one to touch you
Never thought you’d be the one to feel the same
Now look who’s changed

Crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Bittersweet and it’s all your fault
Crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Bittersweet and it’s all your fault
Crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Bittersweet and it’s all your fault
Crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Mentally fucked and it’s all your fault

Never thought you’d tell me I was special
Never thought to say that I was being a fool
Never thought that you would have me hoping
Never thought that you would string me out so long
What went wrong?

Crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Bittersweet and it’s all your fault
Crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Bittersweet and it’s all your fault
Crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Bittersweet and it’s all your fault
Crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Mentally fucked and it’s all your fault

So crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Bittersweet and it’s all your fault
So crimson and clover, sugar and salt
Mentally fucked and it’s all your fault

So crimson and clover, sugar and salt
I’m mentally fucked and it’s all your fault
