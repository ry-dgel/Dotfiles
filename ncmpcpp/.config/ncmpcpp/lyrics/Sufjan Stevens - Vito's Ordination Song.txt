I always knew you in your mothers arms
I have called your name, I've an idea
Placed in your mind to be a better man
I've made a crown for you, put it in your room
And when the bride groom comes, there will be noise
There will be glad and a perfect bed

And when you write a poem
I know the words, I know the sounds
Before you write it down
When you wear your clothes
I wear them too, I wear your shoes
And the jacket too, I always knew you
In your mothers arms, I have called you son
I've made amends between father and son
Or if you haven't one, rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed, there's a design
To what I did and said

Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
