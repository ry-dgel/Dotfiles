You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous
Nuh badda, text me in a crisis
I believed all of ya dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!
Mmmmm! but I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fi

He said me haffi
Work work work work work work

Dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt
And so me put in
