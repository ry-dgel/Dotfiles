So happy I was invited
Gave me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Living and dying in New York, it means nothing to me
I gave my heart to the army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins and cousins somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me

I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothing enough

Losing my breath
Losing my breath

You and your sister live in a lemonworld I wanna sit in and die
You and your sister live in a lemonworld
You and your sister live in a lemonworld I wanna sit in and die
You and your sister live in a lemonworld

This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
It takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer loving torture party

I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothing enough

You and your sister live in a lemonworld I wanna sit in and die
You and your sister live in a lemonworld
You and your sister live in a lemonworld I wanna sit in and die
You and your sister live in a lemonworld

Losing my breath
