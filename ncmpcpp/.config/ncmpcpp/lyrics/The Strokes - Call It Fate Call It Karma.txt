[Verse 1:]
Close the door
Not all the way
He don’t understand
We don’t understand
So don’t you wanna remind me
I don’t know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

[Chorus:]
Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I’ve waited around and oh no, you are are not around
I made up more time watchin’ you

[Verse 2:]
You got it down now, don’t you?
I wanted to understand your face
So don’t you wanna remind me
I don’t know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

[Chorus:]
Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I’ve waited around and oh no, you are are not around
I made up more time watchin’ you

I needed someone
I needed someone
