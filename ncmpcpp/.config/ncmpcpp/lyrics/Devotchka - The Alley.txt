It's all the same for all of us
A sinking ship to place your trust
It seems so huge to leave to chance

But who among you can resist
Her fingers wrapped around your wrist
From the beast she pulls a lover
From this world you'll need no other
From this world you'll need no other

When it's all too much for you to take
Take a step back for Heaven's sake
It seems so foolish in this light

But who among you can resist
Unfurrowed brows and finger tips
From the beast she pulls a lover
From this world you'll need no other
From this world you'll need no other
