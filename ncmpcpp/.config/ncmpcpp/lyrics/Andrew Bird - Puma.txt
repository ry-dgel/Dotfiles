Do you see particles in the air?
Unguided particles in the air
Do you see particles in the air?
Nobody know notices, nobody cares, oh
Don't try to tell her she's this feline inhuman

Cause if she crosses [?] the rumor that she's a girl and not a puma
And light that shines is not a [?] it's just a tumor

She was radioactive for seven days
How I wanted to holding her anyways
But the doctors, they told me to stay away
Due to flying neutrinos and the gamma rays, oh

Do you see particles?
Unguided particles
Particles
Don't try to tell her that she's this feline inhuman

Cause if she crosses [?] the rumor she's a girl and not a puma
Don't try to tell her she's a girl, that's just a rumor

And she was radioactive for seven days
How I wanted to be holding her anyway
But the doctors, they told me to stay away
Due to flying neutrinos and the gamma rays
She was radioactive for seven days
How I wanted to be holding her anyway
But the doctors, they told me just stay away
Due to flying neutrinos and the gamma rays
