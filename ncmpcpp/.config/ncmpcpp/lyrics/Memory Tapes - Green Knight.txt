Baby you know it's like I'm sleeping (Don't close your mouth)
I feel so close to you now (Don't close your mouth)
And even though I'll never hold you (Don't close your mouth)
I can watch the ones who will (Don't close your mouth)

I wanna give you my love
I wanna call your name
At the sound of my voice you turn away
I remember when you were young and afraid

After all of this time 
I still feel strange
Things that I've done that I can't say
I followed a voice that called my name

Do you remember we running in the summer grass ([you] can't help me)
I hit the water, it was shining like a sheet of glass ([you] can't help me)
I tried to swim back to the surface, something held me back ([you] can't help me)
You didn't even try to reach your hand up to me then ([you] can't help me)
