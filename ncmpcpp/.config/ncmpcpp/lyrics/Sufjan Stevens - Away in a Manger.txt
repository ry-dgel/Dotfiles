Away in a manger, 
no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus 
laid down his sweet head

The stars in the sky 
looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus 
asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, 
the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus, 
no crying he makes

I love thee, Lord Jesus; 
look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle 
until morning is night

Be near me, be near me,
Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus,
I ask you to stay

Close by me, close by me
Forever, Forever, 
and love me, I pray
and love me, I pray
and love me, I pray
