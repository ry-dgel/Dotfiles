You've been dead for years
But you never knew
And the rabid bits of time
Have been eating you

But no one knows where we go
No one knows where we go
When we're dead or when we're dreaming

Oooh-woo ooo
oooh-woo ooo
oooh-woo ooo
oooh-woo ooo

And you've been dead for years
But you never knew
And the rabid bits of time
Have been eating you

No one knows where we go
No one knows where we go
When we're dead or when we're dreaming
