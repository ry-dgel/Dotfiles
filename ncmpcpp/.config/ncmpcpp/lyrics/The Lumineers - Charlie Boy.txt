Charlie boy, don't go to war, first born in forty - four
Kennedy made him believe we could do much more

Ohhh
Lillian, don't hang your head, love should make you feel good
In uniform you raised a man, who volunteered to stand

Ohhh

Play the bugle, play the taps and
Make your mothers proud
Raise your rifles to the sky boys
Fire that volley loud

News was bad on upland ave., metuchen mourn our loss
Sons rebelled, while fathers yelled, and mothers clutched the cross

Ohhh

Play the bugle, play the taps and
Make your mothers proud
Raise your rifles to the sky boys
Fire that volley loud
