Owwwooooo
eee
oooo
        
         
         
e's on the scene
 
         
He's the first to leave
Drinking Ovaltine
Since he was 14

He's self aware
He gave the first TED talk
Can't remember the names
Treats you all the same

[Chorus]
Wahoo
He's a funky duck
Wahoo
He's a funky duck
Ohhhhh
He's a funky duck
Wahoo
He's a funky duck

He's not a duck
I said he's not a duck
He ain't no duck
He's a funky duck

He's a funky duck
I said that he's a funky duck

Iiii funky duck
Funky funky funky funky duck

Oh
Wahoo
He's a funky duck
I said
Wahoo, ooh, ooh
(funky duck)

Funky duck
He's a fu-fun-fun-funky duck
He's a funky duck

I thought i saw a funky duck around here somewhere
He owns a truck
But, but he drives a Saab
