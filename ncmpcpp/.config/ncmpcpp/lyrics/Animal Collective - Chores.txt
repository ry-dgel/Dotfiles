If I say, "Too bad," I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have till I am dead
If I say, "Too bad," I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have till I am dead

Now I've got these chores and I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last, my work is done
Now I've got these chores and I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last, my work is done

If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I

If I say, "Too bad," I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have till I am dead
If I say, "Too bad," I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have till I am dead

Now I've got these chores and I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last, my work is done
Now I've got these chores and I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last, my work is done

If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I

I only want the time to do one thing that I like
I want to get so stoned and take a walk out in the light drizzle
At the end of the day, when there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching

At the end of the day
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching

It's not going to happen
It's not going to happen
It's not going to happen
It's not going to happen
It's not going to happen
