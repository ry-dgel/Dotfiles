Oh Philomena, you in a tawdry gown
Lean to your window, let's slip a ribbon down
A cure to your boredom 
If only you'd let me go down
Down, down

Long summer days can lead to lazy vices
Boys all at idle, left to their own devices
Open up your linen lap and let me go down
Down down

All that I wanted in the world
Was just to live to see a naked girl
But I found I quickly bored
I wanted more
I wanted more

So I'll be your candle
And I'll be your statuette
And I'll be your lashing loop of leatherette
And oh Philomena, if only you'd let me go down
Down down

All that I wanted in the world
Was just to live to see a naked girl
But I found I quickly bored
I wanted more
Oh, so much more

So I'll be your candle
And I'll be your statuette
And I'll be your lashing loop of leatherette
And oh Philomena, if only you'd let me go down
Down, down

Go down
Down, down
Go down, down, down
Go down
