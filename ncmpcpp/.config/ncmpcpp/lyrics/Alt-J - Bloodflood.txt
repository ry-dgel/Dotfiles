C-O-double M-O-N
A wave, an awesome wave,
That rushes skin and widens in blooded veins
Breath in, exhale, I've poked a nerve
He'll slap me like a whale

Slaps the sea-O-double M-O-N.
Tide out, tide in, a flood of blood
To the heart and the fear slipstreams
Breath in, exhale, I've poked a nerve
He'll slap me like a whale

Slaps the sea-O-double M-O-N
Flood of blood to the heart
