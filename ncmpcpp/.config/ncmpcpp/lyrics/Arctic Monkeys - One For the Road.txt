(One for the road, oo-oo)
(One for the road, oo-oo)

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

The cracks in black out blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling, but you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside (one for the road)

So we all go back to yours, (oo-oo) and you sit and talk to me on the floor (oo-oo)
There's no need to show me 'round baby, (oo-oo) I feel like I've been here before (oo-oo)
I've been wondering whether later (oo-oo) when you tell everybody to go (oo-oo)
Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this coming from start
The shake, rattle and roll (one for the road)

So we all go back to yours, (oo-oo) and) you sit and talk to me on the floor (oo-oo)
There's no need to show me 'round baby, (oo-oo) I feel like I've been here before (oo-oo)
I've been wondering whether later (oo-oo) when you tell everybody to go (oo-oo)
Will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster

(Oo-oo, one for the road)
(Oo-oo, one for the road)
(Oo-oo, one for the road)
(Oo-oo, one for the road)

(Oo-oo)
(Oo-oo)
(Oo-oo)
(Oo-oo, one for the road)

So we all go back to yours, (oo-oo) and you sit and talk to me on the floor
(one for the road)
There's no need to show me 'round baby, (oo-oo) I feel like I've been here before
(one for the road)
I've been wondering whether later (oo-oo) when you tell everybody to go
(one for the road)
Will you pour me one for the road?
