Oh you say you love me, Joe
How am I supposed to know?
When you go under the waves
What am I supposed to say?

I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

If I stay here
Trouble will find me
If I stay here
I'll never leave
If I stay here
Trouble will find me
I believe

Joe, I'll always think of you
As a kind of child who knew
This was never gonna last
Oh Joe, you fell so fast

Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?

Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?

I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down (don't drag me in)
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down (don't drag me in)
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down (don't drag me in)
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down (don't drag me in)
What did Harvard teach you?
