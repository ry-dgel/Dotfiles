Suicide
When you know
You mean well
But not if I have to offer

Give it back
It's a joke you can sell
But I still have to laugh

It was a beautiful dream
It was such a beautiful dream
We heard the sound of her voice
Calling out high over the trees
And the clouds disappeared
It was a beautiful dream

I been gone, oh
For so long
It's not right
I think I might have forgotten

But I just get so tired
Can't tell me if I'm always out
Or if I said goodbye

It was a beautiful dream
It was such a beautiful dream
We heard the sound of her voice
Calling out high over the trees
And the clouds disappeared
It was a beautiful dream

Give it back to me now
Give it back to me now
Give it back to me now

It was a beautiful dream
It was such a beautiful dream
We heard the sound of her voice
Calling out high over the trees
And the cloud disappeared
It was a beautiful dream
