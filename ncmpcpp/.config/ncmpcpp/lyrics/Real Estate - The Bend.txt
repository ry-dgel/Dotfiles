Have I not been crude
Or do I sound insincere
I'm just trying to make some sense of this
Before I lose another year
It's all that I can do

'Cause it's so hard to feel
And control you
Like I'm behind the wheel
But it won't steer

Stepping off the stone
Do I want to, No I don't
It was clear in what the path I left behind
And now I feel alone
No matter what I do

'Cause it's so hard to feel
And control you
Like I'm behind the wheel
But it won't steer

Have I not been crude
Or do I sound insincere
I'm just trying to make some sense of this
Before I lose another year
