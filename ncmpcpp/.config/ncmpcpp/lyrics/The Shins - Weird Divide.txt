Several days a month you made the mile to my house
And had me do a stroll with you
Far below a furry moon our purposes crossed
The weird divide between our kinds 

The silver leaves of ailing trees took flights as we passed
So long ago, but a short time I know
It pleases me this memory has swollen up with age
Even time can do good things to you
