Wait, honey honeyWait, honey honeyI will never get to sleep          
           Rebel, rebel, no
I can never get to sleep
I'm a rebel, rebel, no
Hold me til I get to sleep

Oh baby bring me home to bed
Rebel, rebel, no
Lightening dances in my head
Devil, devil, whoa-oh-oh
Burning steady as a motor
Not a pebble, pebble
Baby, bring me home to bed
I need you to press me down before my body flies away from me

Your power
Inside
It rocks me like a lullaby
Your power 
Inside
It rocks me like a lullaby
Your power
Inside
Oh baby, I just don't know why
Your power
Your power inside

Waiting for you
Hurry up

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Can you see my face at all?
My man likes me from behind
Tell the truth I never mind
Cause you bomb me with lies, humiliations everyday
You bomb me so many times I never find my way
Come on and bomb me
Why won't you bomb me?
Come on and bomb
Go on and whoa-oh-a-woah-a-oh-ooh-oh

Your power
Inside
It rocks me like a lullaby
Your power
In my mine
It gives me thrills I can't describe
Your face in mine
Oh baby, I just don't know why
Your power
Inside
Your power
