In my head you dance like curtains in the wind.
You're my burden.
I can't feel your heart.
I've been gone.
I can't release these sighs.

You won't hear.
You won't know.
You won't ever know.
Harden your heart.

It was falling from the start.
Though I tried I was always dead inside.
Midnight song.
Sing you to the moon.
I am your quiet night.
You were gone too soon.

I can't feel your heart.
I've been gone. I've been gone.
I can't release these sighs.
You won't hear. You won't know.
