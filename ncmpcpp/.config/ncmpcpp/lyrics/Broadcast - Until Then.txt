If you think nothing is yours
And if I think everything belongs to me
How wrong I'll be, none of us have anything
There's a place I have never explored
Another world we have yet to conquer
And until then none of us have anything

If you think nothing is yours
And if I think everything belongs to me
How wrong I'll be, none of us have anything
