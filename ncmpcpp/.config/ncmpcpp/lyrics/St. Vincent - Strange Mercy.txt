Oh little one I know you've been tired for a long, long time
And oh little one I ain't been around for a little while
But when you see me, wait

Oh little one your Hemingway jawline looks just like his
Our father in exile
For God only knows how many years
But when you see him, wave
Through double pane

I'll be with you lost boys
Sneaking out where the shivers won't find you

Oh little one I'd tell you good news that I don't believe
If it would help you sleep
Strange mercy

If I ever meet the dirty policeman who roughed you up
No I... I don't know what
If I ever meet the dirty policeman who roughed you up

I'll be with you lost boys
Sneaking out where the shivers won't find you
