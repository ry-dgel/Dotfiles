Sheep dog
Been nipping at your heels all day
Sheep dog

Leapfrog
Don't have a way to stay in line
And so you're mine

So close
As gentle as a sleeping baby boy

You can see a sheep where she lay
You can keep a temptress at bay
To keep what's another day
You should lead them to a new place
Cocoon a space to say so simply
Fool these ugly thoughts what are they

Good guy
Don't know you when you hide away
You stay inside

So close
As gentle as a sleeping baby boy

You can see a sheep where she lay
You can keep a temptress at bay
To keep what's another day
You should lead them to a new place
Cocoon a space to say so simply
Fool these ugly thoughts what are they
