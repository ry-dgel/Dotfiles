The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today
The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today
(Bells)

The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today
The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today

And so all the good people wanna rescue
All the small people wanna talk to you
All the clever people wanna tell you
All the little people wanna dance its true

But the time has come, the time has come, the time has come, the time has come
The time has come, the time has come, the time has come, the time has come
Ow, wha

The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today
The time has come, the time has come, the time has come today

And so all the good people wanna rescue
From all the small people wanna talk to you
All the clever people wanna tell you
That all the little people wanna dance its true

Cloud, block out the sun
Over me, over me
And spoil, spoil all the fun
Won't you please?

Cloud, block out the sun
Over me, over me
And spoil, spoil all the fun
Won't you please?

If you please, please anyone
Talk to me, talk to me
All you boys, lonely and drunk
On your knees

Us and Them
Over and over again
Us and Them
Over and over again

Us and Them
Over and over again
Us and Them
Over and over and over again

Because all the good people wanna rescue
All the small people wanna talk to you
All the clever people wanna tell you
That all the little people wanna dance, it's true

So it's Us v. Them
Over and over again
Us v. Them
Over and over again

Us v. Them
Over and over again
Us v. Them
Over and over and over and over

It's just Us v. Them
Over and over again
Us v. Them
Over and over and over and over

All the good people wanna rescue
All the small people wanna talk to you
All the clever people wanna tell you
That all the little people wanna dance, it's true

It's just Us and Them
Over and over again
Us v. Them
Over and over again

Us and Them
Over and over again
Us and Them
Over and over again
Us and Them
Over and over again
