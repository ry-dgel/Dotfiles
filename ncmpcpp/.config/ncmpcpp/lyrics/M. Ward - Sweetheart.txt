You have a sweetheart, sweetheart
You have a nice smile, baby
You drove me crazy,
Down lovers lane

I can't explain this love I have for you,
I cannot tame this desire I have for you,
If it starts again... Don't forget I love you.

Oh my love, take my hand
We'll go walking
Moon and stars are shining in the sky
Everyone I know must be jealous,
'Cause they don't have a love such as I

You have a sweetheart, sweetheart
You have a nice smile, baby
You drove me crazy,
Down lovers lane

Oh my love, take my hand,
We'll go walking
Moon and stars are shining in the sky
Everyone I know must be jealous,
'Cause they don't have a love such as I

You have a sweetheart, sweetheart
You have a nice smile, baby
You drove me crazy,
Down lovers lane

I can't explain this love I have for you,
I cannot tame my desire I have for you,
And when it starts again... Don't forget I love you.

Oh my love, take my hand,
We'll go walking,
Don't forget I love you.
