That old good boy mitch just wanted
to tell some jokes
well now I'm just trying
to play some notes
do you know what i say
do you know what i mean?
have you heard through these words
just how I'm seen
there's a reason that i work
so hard at this stuff
when all i want to do
is take it easy

its not a ticket
for you to pick at
other people
who don't know whats up
like you're so sure you do

you kind of make me want to
shut your mouth just to keep out
all of those unfriendly feelings
just because you've got
a lot of wax
and all those first editions
i want you to know
sticks and stones may
break my bones
but words will never hurt me
all i need to know
i knew so early

its so lame that
you could take my feelings
and make yourself feel
like you're better than
anyone else who hasn't heard

listen in between your notes
there's something been going on
while you were busy taking notes
and look in between your moments
there's something good happening
its good to sometimes
slow it down

whats the point in pouring it all out
when you guys just wear it on your coat?
i believe that for this piece of time
we can really crank us up a lot
get your head out from those mags
and websites who try to
shape your style
take a risk just for yourself
and wade into the deep end of the ocean
