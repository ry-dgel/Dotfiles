We can talk by the river, we can walk right out to the sea
I haven't talked much lately, maybe, that's why you never talk to me, ah-ah

So you're at a low, your speeding heart is getting slow
The music fades before your mind, you hold the hand, and whisper man
Man, it feels like space again, you saw her face man, she cries
The river sticks is getting wide, the Brooklyn waves, the rolling ways
And Jesus says, they both say

We can talk by the river, we can walk right out to the sea
I haven't talked much lately, maybe, that's why you never talk to me, ah-ah

We can talk by the river, we can walk right out to the sea
I haven't talked much lately, maybe, that's why you never talk to me, ah-ah

It took you all the time to know, it took him all the time to know
It took you all the time to know, it took him all the time to know
It took you all the time to know
