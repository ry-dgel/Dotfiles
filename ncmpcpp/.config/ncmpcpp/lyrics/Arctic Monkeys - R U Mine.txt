I'm a puppet on a string, Tracy Island
Time traveling diamond cutter shaped heartaches
That's come to find you, 4 in some velvet morning years too late
She's a silver lining, lone ranger riding
Through an open space in my mind
When she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I want to be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I want to hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
I keep imagining meeting
Wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I want to be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I want to hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine?)

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken I just want to hear you say
"You've got me, baby are you mine?"

She's a silver lining, lone ranger riding
Through an open space in my mind
When she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I want to be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I want to hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
(Or just mine tonight?)
