[Verse 1]
It's in vogue to be feckless
When it comes to the mother taking care of us
I know it's so conventional
But it don't make no sense at all
[Bridge]
But in fact it's a pattern
Everything I hear will always make me ashen
I know its recognizable
But It don't make no sense at all
[Chorus]
Ohhhh no no no sense at all
[Verse 2]
People pay for their coupe
But they can't pay their taxes for the freeway
I know it's so predictable
But it don't make no sense at all
[Verse 3]
And some people say it's on their radar
But they drive a million miles in their fast car
I know it's so invisible
But it don't make no sense at all
[Chorus x2]
[Bridge]
But in fact it's a pattern
Everything I hear will always make me ashen
I know it's recognizable
But it don't make no sense at all
[Chorus x4]
