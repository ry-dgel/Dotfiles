I love you, I hate you
I'm on the fence it all depends
Whether I'm up, I'm down
I'm on the mend

Transcending all reality
I like you, despise you, admire you
What are we gonna do
When everything all falls through?

I must confess I've made a mess
Of what should be a small success
But I digress
At least I've tried my very best I guess

This that the other
Why even bother
It won't be with me on my death bed
But I'll still be in your head

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you
Tell me I'm exceptional I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny

My internal monologue is saturated analogue
It's scratched and drifting
I've become attached to the idea
It's all a shifting dream bitter sweet philosophy
I've got no idea how I even got here

I'm resentful
I'm having an existential time crisis
What bliss
Daylight savings won't fix this mess

Underworked and oversexed
I must express my disinterest
The rats are back inside my head
What would Freud have said?

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you
Tell me I'm exceptional I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny

I wanna wash out my head with turpentine and cyanide
I dislike this internal diatribe
When I try to catch your eye
I hate seeing you crying in the kitchen
I don't know why it affects me like this
When you're not even mine to consider

Erroneous, harmonious
I'm hardly sanctimonious
Dirty clothes, I suppose
We all outgrow ourselves

I'm a fake
I'm a phoney
I'm awake
I'm alone
I'm homely
I'm a Scorpio

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you
Tell me I'm exceptional I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very fun

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you
Tell me I'm exceptional I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny
