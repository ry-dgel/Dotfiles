Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge running low
I tried to fill but it overflowed

Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

She remembers my name
Could be blown way out
It's all going to change
She remembers my name

But she was only messing around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for once
Ooh, no more mischief with my mind

Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold it in next time

No more getting it wrong
I'll be frozen here on
If forever we'll see
But no more guessing for me

Oh, I was just so sure of everything
Ooh, that's what you get for dreaming aloud

Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold in now on
If forever we'll see
But no more guessing for me
