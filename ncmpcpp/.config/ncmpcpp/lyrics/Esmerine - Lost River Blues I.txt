You left me baby a year ago
But I still love you, I'm mourning low
Lord I'm blue and so down hearted
That lonesome old river's my home
I bought you diamonds, fine clothes to wear
Spent all of my money but you don't care
Lord I'm blue and so down hearted
That lonesome old river's my home
It's stormy weather, the sun won't shine
If you don't love me stay out of my mind
Lord I'm blue and so down hearted
That lonesome old river's my home
It makes no difference where I may roam
I'll always love you, honey, come back home
Lord I'm blue and so down hearted
That lonesome old river's my home
