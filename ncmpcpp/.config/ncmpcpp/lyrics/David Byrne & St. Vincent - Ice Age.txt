Oh, diamond, how have you been?
Oh, diamond, it's such a shame
To see you this way, freezing it out
Your own little ice age

Ice age
Ice age

Oh, diamond, get outta bed
All unbuttoned, seams are showin'
It's freaking me out, freezing it out
Your own little ice age

Ice age
Ice age

Ice age
Ice age

We won't know how much we lost
Until the winter thaws
We won't know just what we lost
Until your winter thaws

Oh, diamond, where have you been?
What's close to your bones is far from your shell
So feel it away, reason it out
Your own little ice age

Thaw me out
Thaw me out

Thaw me out
Thaw me out

Thaw me out
Thaw me out
