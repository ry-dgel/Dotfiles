It's time to leave this place where I'm gonna headIt's time to live the most, doubt I hate I'm deadAnd then each spread and kills himself a gift         
         
         But he loves the shameIt's killing me to see you die inside  
         
It's killing time to care if I'm the one
And then the spanner finds you can't unwind
Better fuse this pain

Will you tell me then
What's wrong in our life
Well try to take it out
But not with your life
Know if you're right

The fear takes over when it knows you're down
Fear will follow you into the ground
It's screaming where my meaning is to these left
And the tired feet
Well every fear will not be all okay
Every fear will die to love or hate
The brilliant minds won't save our soul
Until I help them take, take you home

Will you tell me then
What's wrong in our life
Well try to take it out
But not with your life
Bend down, fool
