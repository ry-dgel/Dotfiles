Ah, ah, ah, ah...

A question isn't answered
If an answer isn't questioned
An answer has a meaning
When new meaning has a truth

Past life brings a future
When the future disappears
Conscience of the kingdom
Left the king to reappear

Truth is but a burden
Laying burden by the few
Left unto the story
Tells a story unto you

City of the scripture
Single words on city walls
[?] of freedom
Dropping sequence of our falls

A question isn't answered
If an answer isn't questioned
An answer has a meaning
When new meaning has a truth

Past life brings a future
When the future disappears

Ah, ah, ah, ah...
