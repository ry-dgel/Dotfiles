Hands and toes, feet and head
Carrion to be fed
Any dog can chew over my bone
And all my wine's gonna turn to blood
When my name is called
I'm just a pile of bone

But when I'm gone
And I'm dead
What will be inside me head?

Bone, bone...
Bone, bone...

Fingernail, chest and feet
Carrion good to eat
Any dog can chew over my bone
And all my wine's gonna turn to blood
When my gun is shot
I'm just a bile of bone

But when I'm gone
And I'm dead
What will be inside my head?
Will all my stitches be un-sewn?
If heaven is a place I know
I won't be taking my bones

Bone, bone...
Bone, bone...

If heaven is a place I know
I won't be taking my bones
Will all my stitches be un-sewn?
And when I'm gone
And I'm dead
What will be inside my head?

Bone, bone...
Bone, bone...
