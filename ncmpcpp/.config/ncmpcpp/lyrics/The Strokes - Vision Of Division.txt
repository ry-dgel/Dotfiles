Sing me a song
You could be
Tell me a tale
Just like me
Don't turn it my way
Happy and free
I'll turn it to shit
Happy and free
Oh

All that I do
Is wait for you

I can't get along with all your friends
Don't know how to act
That's all there is
Why do I accept the things you say?
You know what to change
But not in what way

How long must I wait?

I am not you
We could have
I'm almost through
Great success
It's about time
Such a success
That you came through
At no expense

All that I do
Is wait for you

I can't get away from all your friends
I'm not coming back
That's all there is
Why do I accept the things you say?
You know what to change
But not in what way

How long must I wait?
