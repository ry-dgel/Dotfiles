Is it hard to wait
Drowned by your mongrel heart again
If you don't answer where do you want to be found, luv
Duck through the window you're a blight on the town
 
Love is turning you out
Sliding whirling round
I tried to warn you
This waiting game
Will bring that specter down 
 
And would it be wrong
To clamp down on your racing heart love
And if they'd known, persistedâ€¦ oh, to be found, luv
It's not what you deserve

Love is turning you out
Sliding whirling round
I tried to warn you
This waiting game
Will bring that specter down
 
Faster than you can run come your demons
Turn out the lights oh, sacred owl
And if you don't answer would you want to be found, luv
Five days on trapped by their weight

Love is turning you out
Sliding whirling round
I tried to warn you
This waiting game
Will bring that specter down down down
 
Back on this old game you'll be
Cut down in a seedy stairway
If you don't answer would you want to be found, luv
Sapped from the bed to the window
 
Looking back on the time
Starting in the mines
What it is to be twenty-nine
When fame sets your life down
Would it be wrong
Would it be wrong
To disappoint you now disappoint you now
