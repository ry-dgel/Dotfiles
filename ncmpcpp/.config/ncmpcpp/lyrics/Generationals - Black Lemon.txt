I let my old life tie me to the tracks
I heard my best friend tell me
You can never go back
I spent my long years
Learning to get out of the way
I have been taught to turn the other cheek
I get my back stabbed buddy
To the end of the week
I only try to make it to the end of the day
CHORUS:
I've seen it break so many before
I don't wanna stick around
Here and watch anymore
I'm not about to fight until the last of me dies
I'll be resting my eyes
I'll be resting my eyes
Try to follow a path to lead me to the light
But when your load gets heavy
Maybe call it a night
Roll it around and take it from the bottom again
I'm not afraid to lean over the ledge
But if you take too many you go over the edge
Make it a point to tell me when you get to the end
CHORUS:
I've seen it break so many before
I don't wanna stick around
Here and watch anymore
I'm not about to fight until the last of me dies
I'll be resting my eyes
I'll be resting my eyes
I'll be resting my eyes
