Is it all so very simple
And horribly complex?
You suffer in a thimble
And there's nothing coming next

Your mom smokes in the kitchen
Her voice a cutting drone
They're creeping out, you pass the bar
Your father's second home
That leaves you on your own

Nights I'd often watch you
Float across the grounds
Out the gate to the motorway
What secrets have you found?

You had to know I wanted
Something from you then
Too young to know just what it was
Something more than a friend
Is that you at the end?

Well, you play in the street at night
You blow like a broken kite
My girl, you're giving up the fight
Are you gonna let these Americans
Put another dent in your life?

My mother says your dirty
They're gonna find you dead
But have you got that final chapter
Written in your head?

'Cause every single story
Is a story about love
Both the overflowing cup
And the painful lack thereof
You got the heart of a dove

But you play in the street at night
(The street at night)
You blow just like a broken kite
(A broken kite)
My girl, you're giving up the fight
(Giving up the fight)
You'll have to lose all them childish notions
If you're gonna let these American boys
Put another dent in your life

You play in the street at night
(The street at night)
You blow just like a broken kite
(A broken kite)
My girl, you're giving up the fight
(Giving up the fight)
You'll have to lose all them childish notions
Are you gonna let these Americans
Put another dent in your life?
