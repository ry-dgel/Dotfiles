He had a rainy day
I'm in a snake-backed situation
Here's a pencil pack
I'm gonna spread some information

You, making me happier, while I am snappier 
While I'm with you
I, got to be having you, 'cause I am happier
When I met you

You're my little symphonia
(Singing the weather)
I get a dogged blue ring
(Blue - Oooh oooh oooh)
I get a slapped back gecko
(Thought you were younger)
I get a purple string
('Cause it isn't in tune)

Beside the whistle cab
(Singing the hours)
Along a frosty roadside
(Always in time)
I get another ring
(Making me happy!)
That it'll turn me for another ride
(Up in the sky)
Woah, Oh you know, she knows, you're high

You, making me happier, while I am snappier 
While I'm with you
I, got to be having you, 'cause I am happier
When I met you

Is that a dream-storm?
(Dreaming in and out of style)
I get an eight o'clock sit down
(Dreaming for the other half so I can get on down)
Out in the country fields
(Running, smiling, laughing, jumping, fun)
I feel the love of the pretty sun
(Shinning on me!)

Just having fun
Jump, laugh and smile and having fun
Laugh, smile and love and get on down
Smile, love and burn and get on down

Jump, laugh and smile and having fun
Laugh, smile and love and get on down
Smile, love and burn and get on down 

Jump, laugh and smile and having fun
Laugh, smile and love and get on down
Smile, love and burn and get on down...
