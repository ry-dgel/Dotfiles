I count the days, the Great Frontier
Forgiving, faced the seventh year
I stand in awe of gratefulness
I can and call forgetfulness

And when I, and when I call
The patient, the patient fall
The spirit, the carpenter
Invites us to be with her

What have we become America?
Soldiers on the Great Frontier
Carpenter and soldier, one on one
It's the battle, volunteer

The prairie, the frontier (Run from yourself, from your friends)
The perfect farm, it's from here (From ya)
The fortress, the faker (Run for your life, for your friends)
The cornerstone, the baker (Run for your life, for your friends, for ya)

The dancer, the fisher (American, 'Merica)
Audition and the disher ('Meri)
The boxer, the fetcher (Oh Illinois, Illinois)
The chewing gum, dream catcher (Illi')

I count the days the Great Frontier
Forgiving, faced the seventh year
I stand and strain to make ends meet
Five spirits on the Grand Marquee

And when I, and when I call
The Patient, the Patient fall
The Spirit, the Carpenter
Invites us to be with her

There was a man at the wall
He was grateful for us all
I saw the wise woman sing
She wasn't asking anything
She wasn't asking anything
How she made the nations sing

What have we become America?
Soldiers on the Great Frontier

The mattress, the floozies (Run from yourself, from your friends)
The actress at the movies (From ya)
The lantern, the lotion  (Run for your life, for your friends)
The wind that wakes the ocean (For ya)

The Standard Edition (American, 'Merica)
The architect's rendition ('Meri)
The fashion, the fevers (Oh Illinois, Illinois)
The house we got at Sears (Illi')

Oh Great Fire of Great Disaster
Oh Great Heaven, oh Great Master
Oh Great Goat, the curse you gave us
Oh Great Ghost, protect and save us

Oh Great River, green with envy
Oh Jane Addams, spirit send thee
Oh Great Trumpet and the singers
Oh Great Goodman, King of Swingers (Given what you lost are you better off?)
Oh Great Bears and Bulls, Joe Jackson (Given what you had, has it made you mad?)
(Celebrate the few, celebrate the new)
Oh Great Illinois (It can only start with you)
