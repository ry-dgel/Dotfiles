As you lie before me now like a shadow
On a pea green sea
Never thought that I could find you so hollow
Laying into me

But this cup of wine
All salt and brine's made me sleepy
The sorrow sows 
A field of tears that will never yield a single penny
But I don't know
I've got nothing to hold onto

Wished for gold so I could buy you a palace
By the riverside
You'd come in and I would fill your diamond chalice
You were still alive

But this cup of wine
All salt and brine's made me sleepy
And sorrow sows
A field of tears that will never yield a single penny
But I don't know
I've got nothing to hold onto
I've got nothing to hold onto

Were you sleepless tearing at the air?
Was the water everywhere?
Were you fretful to wade into the room?
I'd been wanting to hear from you - Oh no

Hand it over (Hand it over)
Hand it over (Ooh-ooh)
You're weary lay 'em down
You did your time so thank you very much
Hand it over (Hand it over)
Hand it over (Ooh-ooh)
So now your hopes are all laid
But you hand it all away

Did his eyelids affix on empty chairs
You had traveled to lay beside?
A gentle torture to watch it all recede
And all the while your mother slept beside him - Oh no

Hand it over (Hand it over)
Hand it over (Ooh-ooh)
You're weary lay 'em down
You did your time so thank you very much
Hand it over (Hand it over)
Hand it over (Ooh-ooh)
So now your hopes are all laid
But you hand it all away

Were you sleepless tearing at the air?
Was the water everywhere?
Were you fearful and longed to run away
From the cold clasp of Illinois? - Oh no

Hand it over (Hand it over)
Hand it over (Ooh-ooh)
You're weary lay 'em down
You did your time so thank you very much
Hand it over (Hand it over)
Hand it over (Ooh-ooh)
So now your hopes are all laid
But you hand it all away
But you hand it all away
