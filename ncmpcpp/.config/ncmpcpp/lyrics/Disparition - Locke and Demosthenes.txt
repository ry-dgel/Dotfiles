It's becoming very clearWhat you're doing hereIt's becoming very clear

Just what you're doing hereYou gotta move on

You better move on

Rubies and pearls
The treasure of the nights
Staying in an open room
Watching figures of ice

Rubies and pearls
Treasure of the nights
Staying in an room
Watching figures of ice
You can have them all
You can have them all
Tell me all about it

It's becoming very clear
That you shouldn't be here
You cracked up
Your brain collapsed
It passed the time
And it filled the gaps
You couldn't take it
You couldn't take it
Don't cry!
