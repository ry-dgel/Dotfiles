whenever paul thinks of rain, 
swallows fall in a wave and tap on his window with their beaks
whenever paul thinks of snow, 
soft winds blow round his head and his phone rings just once
late at night-like a bird calling out, 
"wake up, paul. don't be scared. 
don't believe you're all alone."
"wake up, paul," whisper clouds rolling by and the seeds 
falling softly from the branches of the trees.
