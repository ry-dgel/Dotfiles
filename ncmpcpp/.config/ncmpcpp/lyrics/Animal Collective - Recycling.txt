Don't care whether this ship sails or sinks into the meat
Don't know if a lesson matters less than what's to eat

While you got it, you figure
Why not launch off of the very highest rope?

Not trying to be shore side scoping breaks to score a ride
More like causing fractures from the deep to make the tide

Who needs slicker tools to build a portrait out of place
Not trying to be sneaky when it's wanting face to face

When you're rotten, you figure
Why not stick up for the very finest dope?

Don't care if a lesion's clotting up or ceases to bleed
Don't know if a lesson is a pleasure or a need

While you're huffing, you figure
Why not soak up all the craze instead of cope?
