You can try, but ain't no use
I'll lose it if you cut me loose
You can try, but ain't no use
I'll lose it if you cut me loose

Darling please don't hesitate
Can I get you now, or must I wait?
I can feel my patience running thin

I stare the walls, walk the floor
But somehow end up at your door
And you refuse to let me in

But something ain't quite right with me
I can't seem to let you be
My love won't wait

So I come by when you're most alone
My coat pockets full of stones
To hurl at your window while you sleep

And you're gonna let me hang around
Or I'll tear your playhouse down
Run to the river bridge and leap

'Cause something ain't quite right with me
I can't seem to let you be
My love won't wait

But don't you fret and don't you fear
While I whisper in your ear
"There's no escape"

'Cause something ain't quite right with me
I can't seem to let you leave
My love won't wait

So don't you threat, don't you fear
While I whisper in your ear
There's no escape

You can try, but ain't no use
I'll lose it if you cut me loose
