I don't mean any harm
You can trust me like you would trust your own brother
But he's just nicer
And I will die soon
That's what they say when I corrupted your laughter

The doctor puts stronger things
To tell us you couldn't have babies
To tell us you couldn't have babies

I don't mean any harm
You can trust me like you would trust your own brother
Maybe even better
And I won't doubt he'd sue me
That's what you said after you watched the disease cold

The doctor conceals her grin
To tell us you couldn't have babies
To tell us you couldn't have babies
