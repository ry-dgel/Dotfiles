There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time
And I'm running out of things to do to get you off my mind, oh
All I have is this picture in a frame (oh, ah)
That I hold close to see your face everyday
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
It's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
It's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me.
It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are
You're so far, this long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are
You're so far, this long distance is killin' me
Now the minutes feel like hours
And the hours feel like days (Whoa, oh)
While I'm away (Away)
You know right now I can't be home (Ah)
But I'm comin' home soon (Ah)
Coming home soon (Ah)
All I have is this picture in a frame (Ah)
That I hold close to see your face everyday.
With you is where I'd rather be (where I'd rather be)
But we're stuck where we are (oh, oh)
It's so hard (oh, ah), we're so far (oh, ah)
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me (you were here with me)
But we're stuck where we are (ohh)
It's so hard (oh, ah), we're so far (oh, ahh)
Can you hear me crying?
Oh (oh ah, oh ah)
Can you hear me crying? (Oh, ah)
Oh (oh ah, oh ah)
Can you hear me crying? (Oh, ah!)
Oh (oh ah, oh ah)
Oh, woah (oh, ah)
Oh, no (oh ah, oh, ah)
With you is where I'd rather be (where I'd rather be), whoa
(But we're stuck where we are) Oh!
(It's so hard) So hard (we're so far), so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you are here with me (you are here with me)
(But we're stuck where we are) Stuck where we are, so hard, so far
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are
You're so far, this long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are
You're so far, this long distance is killin' me
