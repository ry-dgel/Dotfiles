(Woo) The world is crowded
Did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
(Woo) The world is crowded
Did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?
Yes you did

She made me buy her a chameleon
With each eye on a different sun
She made me watch Evangelion
In another life did she blow my brains out?

(Woo) The world is crowded
Did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
(Woo) The world is crowded
Did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?
Yes you did

She found me in Robot Restaurant
Now Iâ€™ll give her whatever she want
Would she listen to a recording of my silly voice
On the last day of her life?

(Woo) The world is crowded
Did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
(Woo) The world is crowded
Did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?
Yes you did
