Begin again
This time you should take a bow at the very end
It's quite an act you put on
Wait til the cameras roll
You're the leading man
In a film where the end of the world
Is decided by you
Whenever you choose

Oh from the sky
A brilliant light will dissolve us all

Begin again
And tell me all about the one that you love
And all about the other one
That you've got on the side
I don't give a damn
About you fooling around behind sherry's back
It's just the one that you found
Is the one that i need

Oh from the sky
A brilliant light will dissolve us all

Listen to this halfwit
Spilling his guts after a bottle of wine
Thought this would be a good time
Now i can't finish my drink
Let him laugh it off
Hey it's a city the size of a dinner plate
It's hard not to overlap
What could you expect

Oh from the sky
A brilliant light will dissolve us all

Now i'm kicking leaves
Cursing the one that i love and the one i don't
I wonder who you're thinking of
