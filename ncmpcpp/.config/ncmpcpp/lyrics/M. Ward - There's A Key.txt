So I'm losing my marbles
One marble at a time, it's true.
When I'm stuck between what we have done,
And what we're gonna do.

There's a key on my piano that I play for you.

And now I'm conquering an ocean 
One wave at a time, it's true.
'Cause I can not beat the devil,
I'm taking on the deep, deep blue.

Armed with this key on my piano that I play for you

Can you hear it?
Can you see the continental divide?
Oceans wide till you jump inside this tidal wave with me

So i'm losing my marbles
One marble at a time, it's true
When I'm stuck between what we have done
And what we're gonna do (what we're gonna do)

There's a key on my piano that I play for you.
