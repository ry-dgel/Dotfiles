Sitting up on our crane, it always feels the same
When we're up high 'cause I feel like I fall and die
And I can't say goodbye to my friends
'Cause they're having a real good time
Get up on our plane, it always feels the same
When we're up high 'cause I feel like I crash and die
And I can't say goodbye to my love
She's been sleeping all our flight

And you know it's gonna get you feeling like you're gonna die
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming out
As your spirit towards the ground

Sitting up on our crane, it always feels the same
When we're up high 'cause I feel like I fall and die
And I can't say goodbye to my friends
'Cause they're having a real good time

And you know it's gonna get you feeling like you're gonna die
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming out
As your spirit towards the ground
Oh, it's gonna get you feeling like you're gonna die
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming out
As your spirit towards the ground

All I wanna do is get drunk and listen to Dennis Wilson
'Cause he's the man, oh yeah-yeah-yeah, 'cause he's the man, yeah-yeah
