whatever the girl inside you are,
you are walking, you are still walking
but if the early light has it tonight and i'm
i'm like one earring if you steal one earring

whatever's in light i need you inside you are
you are walking, you are still walking
but if the early light has it tonight and i'm
i'm like one earring if you steal one earring

lady can't wear no hat, can't no wear no coat
never her coat

do me, beauty
rock me up, yup go once again
hug me, beauty
oop, the way this life is clearing into my brains
fool me, beauty
let me think of home once again
hear me, beauty
you gotta hide away the secret of your low bone this man
