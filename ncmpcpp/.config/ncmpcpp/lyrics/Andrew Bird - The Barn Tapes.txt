I got home this morning
With the sun right in my eyes
And there was no warning
Yes, it took me by surprise
As it hit me like an act of God
Causing my alarm
That I had not become a cephalopod
I still had legs and arms
Yes, I still had legs and arms
And today was supposed to be the day
Molecules decide to change their form
Laws of physics lose their sway
And youthful indiscretion now is suddenly the norm
With the good kids sprouting horns
Yeah, yeah
And today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Was supposed to be
Today was supposed to be opposite day
Those who can't quite function
In society at large
They're going to wake up on this morning
And find that they're in charge
But those the world's set up for
Who are really doing quite well
They're gonna wake up in institutions
In prison or in hell
In prison or in hell
And today was supposed to be the day
Molecules decide to change their form
Laws of physics lose their sway
And youthful indiscretion now is suddenly the norm
With the good kids sprouting horns
Yeah, yeah
And today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Just another day, no
Today was supposed to be, no no
Just another day, oh no
Today was supposed to be, oh no
Not just another day
It was supposed to be
Today was supposed to be opposite day
But if you think there's something else
Well, you're right
There is, there's something else
But if you think I'm gonna tell you
Think again
Why should I even think of telling you what there is
Yeah, 'cause silence is knowledge and knowledge is power
I'm under explicit orders to dare not speak it's name
Listen up, I just work here, oh, I dare not speak it's name
I can't keep talking about it, oh, I dare not speak it's name
