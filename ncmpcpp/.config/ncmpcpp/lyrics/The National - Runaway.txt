There's no saving anything
Now we're swallowing the shine of the sun
There's no saving anything
How we swallow the sun

But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway

But what makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, lose our shirts in the fire tonight
But what makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood
We got another thing coming undone

But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway

But what makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, lose our shirts in the fire tonight
But what makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking forever

I'll go braving everything
With you swallowing the shine of the sun
I'll go braving everything
Through the shine of the sun

But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway

But what makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over

And it's taking forever
