Now dissolve me, two tabs on your tongue,
A herd of shepherds to herd the sheep, sleep now my only one.
Broken sweethearts who sleep apart
Both still pine for the other side's spine, spoon as sleep starts.

And pulse to pulse, now shush.
She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes
To calm me down.

I am see-through, soap sliver you're so thin,
As I begin rubbing lathers up your state worsens on my skin.
And gold, fatless finger to lip, one two three four hush.
And pulse to pulse, now shush.

She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes
To calm me down.
She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes
I'm tired now.

She makes the sound the sea makes, knee-deep in the north sea
She makes the sound the sea makes, knee-deep in the north sea
She makes the sound the sea makes, knee-deep in the north sea
She makes the sound the sea makes, knee-deep in the north sea
She makes the sound the sea makes, knee-deep in the north sea
She makes the sound the sea makes, knee-deep in the north sea
She makes the sound the sea makes, knee-deep in the north sea
She makes the sound the sea makes, knee-deep in the north sea
