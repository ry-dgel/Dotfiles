We walked along the rocks for nearly an hour
I caught the way you looked at me in the sunlight
You took something before you went in the shower
To help suppress the things that make you feel uptight
If I had known you couldn't swim we would never have gone in
I left my love in the river
The only one who sees
I lost his hand in the current
It was the life I wanted and I hoped for
And now I'm left sifting through the reeds
The sun so hot, I saw his skin through his t-shirt
The grass so tall, I knew we wouldn't be found
We climbed into the stream sure no one would be heard
And in no time at all there wasn't a sound
If I had known you couldn't swim we would never have gone in
I left my love in the river
The only one who sees
I lost his hand in the current
It was the life I wanted and I hoped for
And now I am left sifting through the reeds
Now cold to the skin, inform the next of kin
Now cold to the skin
I left my lover in the river
The only one I see
I lost his hand in the current
And now I am left flowing through the trees
