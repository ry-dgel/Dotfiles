You won't find it by yourself, you're gonna need some help
And you won't fail with me around, come on, let's go
I will tell you if you change and who's been saying things
It's hard to tell who is real in here, come on, let's go

You know who to turn to, now everything's changed, come on, let's go
Stop looking for answers in everyone's face, come on, let's go
What's the point in wasting time
On people that you'll never know, come on, let's go

When you're looking for a friend but it's empty at the end
When everybody's disappeared you won't be alone
If you want I'll compensate, if you over estimate
So there's nothing left to fear, you won't be alone

You know who to turn to, now everything's changed, come on, let's go
Stop looking for answers in everyone's face, come on, let's go
What's the point in wasting time
On people that you'll never know, come on, let's go
You know who to turn to, now everything's changed, come on, let's go
Stop looking for answers in everyone's face, come on, let's go
What's the point in wasting time on people that you'll never know
When you know who to turn to, now everything's changed
