All the pieces are where they ought to be
But it's clear that we don't look lightly
Take a place around the tabletop
Make a push to wake the moment up

Say, you want to say what's wrong
Any way to blow up the cover
There's a way through bogs
As long as there's a light to discover it

Like a twisted stick, let's dig through the sick and find a level space
Cinch to say

It's a gut that feels all things unknown
And a ring within the brain, you know
Not ashamed to say the instinct's there
But a virtue to deny the bait

Know the cost and move to cause an endeavor
Globbed onto something
In the lawn, there's room to improve
As there's a need to uncover it

As a joker sucks, let's sift through the muck and lift this dingy veil
Same old tale

Get mixed in this crippling fixture, try and approach the hidden mixtures
Get mixed in this crippling fixture, try and approach the hidden nature

For a misplaced stash, let's search through the trash and write this ignorant lurch
Wicked urge

Raise the gab above a whisper, speak to sound a spoiling blister
Raise the gab above a whisper, talk to cure a blistered picture
