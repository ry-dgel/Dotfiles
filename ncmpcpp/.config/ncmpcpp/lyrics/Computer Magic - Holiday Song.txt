I
an't
tand the way you talk
        
         
         so
lose where I don't mind
 
         
'cause
in the room I feel
just
what you're going though.

I try
to
talk sometimes
but
nothing
comes out right
can we
just
book a flight
to nowhere?

-chorus-
Can we just get
away?
Can we just say
a holiday?
We'll take your coat
and find a place
a place to stay
a holiday.
And we'll feel fine
and they'll all say
"Where have they gone?"
"They've gone away."

I
can't
stand the cold
except
when
you're around
be
careful
on your own
you're
getting
too drunk now.
The
lights
are
getting low.
I'm tired
yeah
of the night.
Can we
just
book a flight
to nowhere?

-chorus-

They've gone away.
They've gone away.
Where have they gone?
They've gone away.
