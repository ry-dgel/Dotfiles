I'm not ready for it
But then ever I could be
I'm not ready for it
But then ever I could be

I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not

No name for her but as it comes
We'll name each after its way
No name for her but as it comes
We'll name each after its way

I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not

As with all else any piece
Has its place and form to fill
As with all else any piece
Has its place and form to fill

I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not
