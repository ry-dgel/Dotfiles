Sapphire her burning eyes, model euphonic paradigms
Awkwardness happening to someone you love
Awkwardness happening to someone you love

The black cat, the black cat, curiouser and curiouser
The black cat, the black cat, curiouser and curiouser

Shadowing masonic verve follows the pharaoh and the worm
Awkwardness happening to someone you love
Awkwardness happening to someone you love

The black cat, the black cat, curiouser and curiouser
The black cat, the black cat, curiouser and curiouser

Mirror mirror on the wall into the purring night you call
Awkwardness happening to someone you love
Awkwardness happening to someone you love

The black cat, the black cat, curiouser and curiouser
The black cat, the black cat, curiouser and curiouser

Awkwardness happening, awkwardness happening
