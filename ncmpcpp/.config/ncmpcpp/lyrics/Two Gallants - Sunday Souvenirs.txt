I have seen the summer sun come rest upon your cheek
And I have seen young Hercules grow feeble and grow weak
Memories of what I gave away
Lost love all the love that's lost along the way
Slow down let me hold you once before you fade

When all of my leaving is done then I will take my rest
Count all my possessions when there's no possessions left
Memories are all i have today
Lost love all the love that's lost and gone away
Slow down let me hold you once before you fade

And all my friends and family and lovers I have known
You know you mean much more to me than I have ever shown
Memories of what I gave away
Lost love all the love that's lost and gone away
Slow down let me hold you once before you fade
