Peoria! Destroyia! 
Infinity! Divinity! 

For Lydia! Octavia! 
And Jack-of-Trades! 
The Cubs! Hooray! 

The Opera House 
Where Emma sang! 
America! Oh will it play? 

And Santa Clause! 
The Great Parade! 
Peoria! 
You have it made! 

Into the crossfire 
faithfully run 
Middle America, 
one on one 
Peoria! 
we saddle the fun times
