Talk to yourself
Please make your mind up
Is there anything left at all?

Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

I never leave the light on
Please make your mind up
Weary when I do us wrong
But we try
Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

Cloistered from yourself
You never even try
Best just lie down
And close your eyes for once
Before your will just goes

Surrounded by the throng
A mounting wave of sound
The clamor breaks me down
The ground beneath me gone
The sky might open up
