Tell my why, tell me who, tell me you don't know what to do
Get it all over you
Who will know how to fight?-only you
Tell my why, tell me who, tell me you don't know what to do
Get it all over you
Who will know how to fight?-only you
You're with me
And other times
I don't care
If it's wrong or right
You reach in
And I reach out
Time will tell what we're all about
Tell my why, tell me who, tell me you don't know what to do
Get it all over you
Who will know how to fight?-only you
Tell my why, tell me who, tell me you don't know what to do
Get it all over you
Who will know how to fight?-only you
You're with me
And other times
I don't care
If it's wrong or right
You reach in
And I reach out
Time will tell what we're all about
(Instrumental interlude)
You're with me
And other times
I don't care
If it's wrong or right
You reach in
And I reach out
Time will tell what we're all about
