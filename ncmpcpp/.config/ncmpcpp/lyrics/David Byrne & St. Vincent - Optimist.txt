Waiting, but I don't mind
I'm all bus stops and heat
I'm neon, in your daylight

I'm the optimist of 30th Street
How it is is how it oughta be

I got anything but moneyed esteem
Drinks on Cond√© Nast
I'm the optimist of 30th Street
How it is is how it oughta be

I spy Vivian Girls on the Up-Upper East
There's no reason to be upset
There's no reason to not expect

There's no room for emptiness
No tea or sympathy
There's no room for emptiness
On a never-empty street
