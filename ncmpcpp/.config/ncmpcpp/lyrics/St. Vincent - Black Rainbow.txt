There's a black rainbow upon my house
Match the curtains and the floors
Think I'm glass I think I'm breaking it
Wrecking ball outside the door

Let the children act like furniture
For the ladies of the lawn
But I can't see them, I can't see at all
It's night time all the time

Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
Tell him I got nothing for him
Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
What's he gonna win when he wins?

Unkissed boys and girls of paradise
Lining up around the block
Back pockets full of dynamite
While neighbors talk and talk and talk

Bird outside the kitchen fighting his reflection
Tell him I got nothing for him
Bird outside the kitchen fighting his reflection
What's he gonna win when he wins?

Throw the phone out the window
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout out loud
And set the bell and slow
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout even louder
