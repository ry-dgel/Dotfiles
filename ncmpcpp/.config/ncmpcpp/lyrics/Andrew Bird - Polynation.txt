You were a shameless child
Bandied by stiff cross currents
Anything but mild
Yes and no just simply weren't
Invented yet
Oh yes oh no

Then one day you'd had it
Exiled your close advisors
Ousted your dog-eared rabbits
You're through with pacifizers
You're through with pacifizers now

Here we go mistaking clouds for mountains
Here's the thing that brings the sparrows to the fountains
Here's the thing that makes you run for the highlands
Here we go mistaking clouds for mountains
Autonomy
