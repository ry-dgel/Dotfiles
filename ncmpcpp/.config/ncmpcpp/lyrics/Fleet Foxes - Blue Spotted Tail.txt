Why in the night sky are the lights hung? 
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun? 
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one 
Why in the night sky are the lights hung? Oh

Why is life made only for to end? 
Why do I do all this waiting then?
Why this frightened part of me that's fated to pretend? 
Why is life made only for to end? Oh

In the city only for a while 
Here to face the fortune and the bile 
I heard you on the radio, I couldn't help but smile 
In the city only for a while, oh

Why in the night sky are the lights hung? 
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun? 
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one 
Why in the night sky are the lights hung? Oh
