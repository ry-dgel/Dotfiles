All your precious souls
Have been bought and sold
For bargain basement lows
To common criminals

So you are having visions 
Adverse flying conditions
Overseas transmissions
To anyone who will listen

You're waiting for the drums to kick in
You want to free your earthbound limbs
I am gonna count to three
Then you are leaving here with me

Are we wasting all our precious time?
Chasing dollars, chasing dimes
German, English, Japanese
All the sand in all the seas

It's all in place, it's all laid out
And as we speak it's going down
Oh, don't forget me regretfully
Here's the part that always gets me

You float across the room
Your lips are in full bloom
Petals fall from your mouth
Have you found me out?

You've been here before
A lover's civil war
I will wait religiously 
Don't forget that you came here with me

Are we wasting all our precious time?
Chasing dollars, chasing dimes
German, English, Japanese
All the sand in all the seas

It's all in place, it's all laid out
And as we speak it's going down
Oh, don't forget me regretfully
Here's the part that always gets me
