I was out for a walk downtown last Saturday night
Coming back from a show or something like that
And I looked up at the sky and it was dark and covered with clouds
And I thought about how I needed to get some kind of job

And I thought about how living out of a van isn't as romantic as it's made out to be
Especially when the only one in the van is me
And I sat down on the curb and watched a squirrel get hit by a car
And I wondered where you are, whoever you are

Every bit of the body needs something to do
Every good album needs a slow song or two
So out with the adenoids and in with the ballads
Every future needs androids, every model needs salads

Well as I was sitting there looking from the dead squirrel to the distant taillights of the car that hit it
I thought about how if I did have a real job I'd probably last two weeks and then quit it
And I thought about how my van was pretty nice after all and since I was in my 30s now it seemed appropriate to be driving a minivan anyway
Even if I didn't have an apartment or my own driveway

And then some university girls passed me on their way to 80s night and they were all wearing the same kind of pants
I was sitting on the curb so I didn't notice their faces but they all seemed excited to dance
And I thought about how when I dance people often think I have some kind of rare syndrome or disease
So I don't dance too often but I'd like to dance as often as I pleased

Cause every bit of the body needs something to do
Even agoraphobics need the occasional public rendezvous
You've got to keep dancing if you want to meet some kind of woman or some kind of man
And we're all dancing as fast as we can

Everybody needs a body to be somebody
Everybody needs a body to be somebodyâ€¦.
