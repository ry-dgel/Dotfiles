Cap off, kneelin' at the back of the church
Feelin' water on your brow, with its heal and it hurts
At first, a sharpish pain that returns as a thought
That the needle in your skin won't bring you closer to god

And I watch
As your head
Turns full circle

All hopeless with old coffee and a medical text
It's too easy knowin' nothin', blowin' off the rest
And the riddles in the pages leavin' too much to guess
And the worry cracks a fracture from your hip to your chest

As I watch
As your head
Turns full circle

You got lost in your travels and a spiritual book
Mistook beaches for nirvana, in the way that they look
And the crooks that run the island are killing to keep earning 
They're burning seven tons of plastic and it seems to be working

Is that the best
That I
Can do?

So watch
As your head
Turns full circle

You appear even-tempered though your looks will deceive
And the sparks are always flying 'cause you drink for relief
With the heart of a child and the wit of a fool
It's a wonder why I don't try to build a wall around you

And I watch
As your head
Turns full circle

Yeah, watch
As your head
Turns full circle

Yeah, watch
As your head
Turns full circle
