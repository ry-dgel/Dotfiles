Evening, every night you come and you find meAnd you always remind me that my baby's goneEvening, you got me deeply in your power          
           Every minute seems just like an hour, now that my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on

Oh evening, let me sleep till glow of dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on

Evening, let me sleep till glow of dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my man is gone
