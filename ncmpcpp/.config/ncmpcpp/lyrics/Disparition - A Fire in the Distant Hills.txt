Slow down
These chemicals won't take you anywhere
So let the smoke go down and fill the room
As you look at me for something else to blame

Breathe in deep as the poison fills your lungs
It's nights like these that make mornings a hope will never come
So hold your breath and follow me
Clockwork devices are all we'll ever be

So you do your dance obliterating everything you see
And I do my best to waste it all away

This machine replicates and hums along
The medication rages but the high is all the same
Just a walking catastrophe now
Crashing into you

So it all goes up flames erasing what will never be
And we'll do it all again tomorrow

So it goes and now it's gone
The life we choose is how we'll fall
The way we destroy is the art of it all
This portrait illustrates what you made me out to be
These colors never run, they only fade in time

I've turned to see your reaction
And what I thought it would be
From somewhere in the distance
I hear the sirens scream

Dancer, I remember the night you set this place on fire
With you out there in the middle of the room
Sitting pretty but you know you have

No defense, you have no defense
As we both go down in flames
You hold your breath and wonder why
No defense, you have no defense
Then you do your dance obliterating everything in sight

So it goes and now it's gone
The life we choose is how we'll fall
The way we destroy is the art of it all
This portrait illustrates what you made me out to be
These colors never run, they only fade in time
