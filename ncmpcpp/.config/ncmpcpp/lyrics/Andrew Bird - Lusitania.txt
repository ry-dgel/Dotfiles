If your loose and libel lips
Keep sinking all my ships
Then you're the one who sank my Lusitania
But some how it don't register as pain at all
Till it finds your crooked vein
It should help us not remember the Maine
You're laying mines along your shore
Through my hull it ripped and tore
We don't study this war no more

So we let our back bones slip
Till the arc spits from our fingertips
And we'll become a hazard in the rain
Oh and we'll get charged out in the rain
There's a sixty-cycle hum
Go ahead say something dumb
Boy there's no shame
There's no shame

Go ahead say something dumb boy
There's no shame
