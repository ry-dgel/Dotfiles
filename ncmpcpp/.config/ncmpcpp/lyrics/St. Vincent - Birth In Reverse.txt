Oh, what an ordinary day
Take out the garbage, masturbate
Ha, I'm still holding for the laugh
The dogs will bark, so let them bark
The birds will cry, I'll let them cry
Here's my report from the edge

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm saying
Phenomenal lies
On the cosmic eternity
Party line
Was a birth in reverse
In America

This tune will haunt me through the war
Ha, ha, ha, ha ha
Laugh all you want, but I want more
'Cause what I'm swearing, I've never sworn before

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm saying
Phenomenal lies
On the cosmic eternity
Party line
Like a birth in reverse
In America

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm saying
Phenomenal lies
On the cosmic eternity
Party line
Was a birth in reverse
In America
