You’re no better off, living your life than dreaming at night
This much is true, but it’s still up to you to take my advice

To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

Go home, go home
Go home, go home

You’re better off dead, when your mind’s been set from nine until five
How could it be true, well it’s happening to you, so take my advice

And take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

Go home, go home
Go home, go home

Go home, go home
Go home, go home
