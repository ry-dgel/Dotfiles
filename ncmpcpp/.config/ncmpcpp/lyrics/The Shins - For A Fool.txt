Young and bright
But now just a dim light
Off in the distance
A falling stone
Following the path
Of least resistance

If I still fight, it's just that I'm
Afraid I'll slide under that spell again

Taken for a fool
Yes, I was because I was a fool
Tell me what you'd do
I lost my way and she took me to school

So many times
Caught up in my head at night
With a leash and a label
If I can learn
Anything from this, then I'd be like
The fox in the fable of life

If I still fight, it's just that I'm
Afraid I'll slide under that spell again

The way we used to carry on
Is stuck in my head like a terrible song

Taken for a fool
Yes I was, and I was a fool
Following their rules
Guess I was a very honest tool

Taken for a fool
Yes I was, because I was a fool
