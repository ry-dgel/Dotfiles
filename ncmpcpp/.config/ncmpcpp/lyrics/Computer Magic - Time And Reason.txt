[Chorus]
Their are many reasons, I'm in love with you,
Make me feel so special, everything that you do, 
How you hold me tight, every day and night, 
And then you give me love girl, I just know your all mine, 
Cause you always show me, I'm worth more than gold, 
Cause your my forever, never wanna let you go, 
And with your kiss I feel, that our love is real, 
I'm feeling blessed my heaven, cuz I know your right here, 
These are the reasons why I love you

[MC Magic]
Has anybody ever came into your life and changed your world, 
More than a beautiful face, a special girl, 
Someone who really understands your soul, 
Even if we separated, I never let you go, 
I spend the rest of my days and nights, 
Living for the moment you came back into my life, 
Cause I can name a million reasons that I can't let you go, 
And the first one, is cuz your so beautiful, 
Oh girl, I just wanna let you no, 
That their is no one, in this whole wide world, 
And the moment that I die, 
I know that you will be, the last thing on my mind, 
So every time that you close your eyes, 
Remember that I'm always on your side, 
The only girl that ever gave me like a million reasons why

[Chorus]
Their are many reasons, I'm in love with you,

How you hold me tight, every day and night, 
And then you give me love girl, I just know your all mine, 
Cause you always show me, I'm worth more than gold, 
Cause your my forever, never wanna let you go, 
And with your kiss I feel, that our love is real,

[Ms. Krazie]
My crazy baby, damn let me count the ways,
That you make me fall in love with you every single day, 
Don't hesitate to wanna stay I'm never leaving you, 
Porque theirs so many rasones why you keep me holding on to you, 
That's why I'm nervous, everytime you call me,
The sound of your voice when you tell me that you love me, 
It's just so hard to say, so I'd rather show you, 
It's just so hard to explain what I feel for you, 
I just want to let you know, 
I love everything you done for me, I appreciate it, 
And I just want to let you know, 
Wanna spend my life with you, be your one and only lady, 
Toda la rasones por las cuales yo te queiro, 
Y varias otras cosas por que sin ti, yo me muero, 
No te vallas de me vida, baby quedate con migo, 
Ahora y por vida, 

[Chorus]

Cause your my forever, never wanna let you go, 
And if you kiss I feel, that our love is real,
