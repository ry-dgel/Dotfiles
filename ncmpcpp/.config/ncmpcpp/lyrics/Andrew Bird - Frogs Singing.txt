Have you ever seen a fish don't be enough from a quiet stream
Shine a moment in the light then fall away again?
Have you seen it, brother? Won't you come outside and see?
Have you ever seen the rain turn the earth to mud
And watched the mud turn gold in the rising sun?

Have you seen it, brother? Won't you come outside and see?
Won't you come with me tonight down to the lowland fields
To hear the frogs singing, the air so hot and still?
Won't you come with me, sister? Won't you come with me tonight?

Down in the flooded fields the earth is wet and dark
Down in the flooded fields beneath the falling stars
Won't you down in the dirt, brother, be a mirror to the night
Won't you down in the dirt, sister, I'll your mirror to the night
Won't you down in the dirt, brother, be a mirror to the night
Won't you down in the dirt, sister, I'll your mirror to the night
