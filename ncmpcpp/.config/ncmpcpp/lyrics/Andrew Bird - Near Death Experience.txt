You used to be like toffee,
Between the kitten's teeth -
You used to build arid shelters out of sticks and leaves and
spend the whole day underneath.

You used to be like copper -
Pliable but strong,
You used to smile and nod, say "you're right," be polite,
When you know that everybody's wrong.

So you dare the plane to crash,
redeem the miles for cash when it starts to dive
And we'll dance like cancer survivors -
like we're grateful simply to be alive.

Dare the plane to crash,
redeem the miles for cash
And we'll dance like cancer survivors -
like your prognosis was that you should've died.

No, there's nothing wrong; there's nothing wrong when it starts to down
And we'll dance like cancer survivors -
like we're grateful simply to be alive

No, there's nothing wrong; there's nothing wrong when it starts to down
And we'll dance like cancer survivors
