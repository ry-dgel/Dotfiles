I cannot see you never again
Oh I could wake cold just to hold your hand
Ain't got much but it can all be yours
A ruined apartment and a hot dog stand

I've been fighting in the attic with hungry ghosts
I've been busy in the common hall
Ripping the plastered-up sheets off the wall
I'll keep calling if it takes all night

Everything's
Well alright
Gonna be
Well alright

Dude this girl was out of it and it cost
At the high school where they get so lost
Hit her hard with a pack of twenty-five
Much too fuel-up, but we stayed alive

Because well she won't come along, not so dumb
Soldered clothes or heavens knows
There's no warmth in the pretty words you say, goodbye
I don't wanna make that happen yet,
Don't mean nothing just some common sense
Not for so much is just the fact we met

Everything's
Well alright
Gonna be
Well alright

Everything's
Well alright
Gonna be
Well alright

I cannot see you never again
Oh I could wake cold just to hold your hand
Ain't got much but it all be yours
A ruined apartment and a hot dog stand

Just watch the endless day, how it goes
Sell your watch, sell your clothes
There's no warmth in the words that you say, goodbye
I don't mean nothing just some common sense
Ain't have enough for your boss, just yet
Nothing much, just the bored big layer

Everything's
Gonna be
Well alright
You and me

Everything's
Gonna be
Well alright
Well alright

Well-alright, well-alright, well-alright, well-alright
Well-alright, well-alright, well-alright, well-alright
