[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Knocked up 9 months ago
And what she gonna have she don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no rock'n'roll
She want platinum or ice or gold
She want a whole lot of somethin' to fold
If you a obstacle she just drop ya cold
'cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad
In these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told the girl look here
Calm down I'm gonna hold your hand
To enable you to keep the plan
'cause you is quick to learn
And we can make money to burn
If you allow me the latest game
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread my wings
And the world gonna know my name

[Verse 2: Cody Chesnutt]
I don't ask, for much these days
And I don't bitch, and whine, if I don't get my way
I only wanna fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow roots standin' where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keepin' my secrets mine

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary dropped my baby girl tonight
I would name her Rock'N'Roll

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Uh-huh
Cadillac needs space to roam
Where we heading for she don't know
We in the city where the pros shake rattle and roll
And I'm a gaddang rollin' stone
I don't beg I can hold my own
I don't break I can hold the chrome
And this weighin' a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One and Black Thought is bad
These streets he done ran ever since when the game began
I never played the fool
Metter of fact I be keepin' it cool
Since money been changing hands
And I'm left to shine, but the legacy I leave behind 
be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread these wings
And the world gonna know my name

[Verse 4: Cody Chesnutt]
I don't beg
From no rich man
And I don't scream, and kick, when his shit don't fall in my hands, man
'cause I know how to steal
Fertilize another against my lover's will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-no dear
You'll be keeping my legend alive

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary dropped my baby girl tonight
I would name her Rock'N'Roll
Oh-ooh break it down, break it down, break down beat

[break]
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked 'cause I've taken my test
Deliver it Mary, it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it rock and roll
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin it right
If Mary drop my baby girl, tonight
I would name her Rock-N-Roll
I would name her Rock-N-Roll
I would name her Rock-N-Roll yeah
I would name it Rock-N-Roll
