Go to sleep, my babyKeep those night thoughts away from your headLet the clock give a tick, the dog give a lick          
           Your heart beats soundly on your dreamboat bed

Go to sleep, my baby
There is nothing the morning can't undo
I will watch and weep at your peacely sleep
And make sure the beddy-bugs don't get you

'Cause they'll try to arm you
That's what they do

How do you keep a bleeding heart wide open?
How do you stand directly where you're standing?
Keep your bleeding heart wide open
When you fall what happens when you're landing?

Go to sleep my baby
The world revolves around your tiny little skull
It will whirr and moan as you hum the drone
That a hurdy-gurdy plays to lift you out of the lull

Go to sleep my baby
Sleep deep now before the wooly wolly gong
For your sleep is guard 'gainst the cold and hard
A soft shroud of safety in a world gone wrong

'Cause they'll try to arm you
That's what they do

How do you keep a bleeding heart wide open?
How do you stand directly where you're standing?
Keep your bleeding heart wide open
When you fall what happens when you're landing?
