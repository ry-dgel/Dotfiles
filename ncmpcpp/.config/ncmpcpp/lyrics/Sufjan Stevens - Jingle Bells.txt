Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Hahaha

Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
