I heard your name the other day
And I got sick in the most wonderful of ways
I thought about the days we laughed about our past
And now you’re stuck there like the time I can’t get back

I said some things that I don’t mean
When I said I hate you I was lying through my teeth
And when you grabbed your bags and walked out of my door
I lost the love, that couldn’t love me anymore

I miss your smile the way we kiss
Who knew that hell could come from something heaven sent

I heard your voice inside my head
I drank all night so i could drown you out of it
I woke up in my car but I couldn’t drive away
I just couldn’t bring myself to leave the girl that couldn’t stay

I miss your smile the way we kiss
Who knew that hell could come from something heaven sent

Whether I was right or I was wrong
Or which of us hung up the phone
I just had to write this song
So I could just feel less alone

I saw your name the other day
I cried myself to sleep and crumbled from the pain
And i couldn’t believe what your daddy asked of me
I never thought id live to give your eulogy
