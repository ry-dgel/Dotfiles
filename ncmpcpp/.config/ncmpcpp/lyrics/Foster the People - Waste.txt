I'll hold your hand when you are feeling mad at me
Yeah, when the monsters they won't go
And your windows won't close
I'll pretend to see what you see

How long, I say how long
Will you relive the things that are gone?
Well yeah, the devil's on your back but I know you can shake him off
Mmmmm

And every day that you want to waste, that you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up, and you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change, that you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through, 'cause I just really want to be with you

You know it's funny how freedom can make us feel contained
When the muscles in our legs aren't used to all the walking, mmmm
I know if you could snap both your fingers, then you'd escape with me
But in the meantime, I'll just wait here and listen to you when you speak
Or scream

And every day that you want to waste, that you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up, and you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change, that you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through 'cause I just really want to be with you

The truth cuts us
And pulls us back up
And separates the things that look the same
You can fight it off, you can fight it off, you can

And every day that you want to waste, that you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up, and you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change, that you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through 'cause I just really want to be with you
