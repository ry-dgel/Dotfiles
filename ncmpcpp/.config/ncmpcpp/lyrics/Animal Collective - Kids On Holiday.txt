Are you waiting for me at the end of the airport?
I'm off buying our tickets, adoring hibernation
But I'm feeling impatient, we were late in departing
And the smell of pajamas is what made me feel frivol
There are minutes for sleeping but we didn't have minutes to spare

So you're feeling sleepy, sympathize with the retard
Being held by his mother, she's got spit in her napkin
And she's pushing him that way, like the stench to the men's room

And it's making you nauseous, where the hell have I got to?
There's a boy whoâ€™s a Krishna and he thinks you look pretty
Well he's eyeing your stockings, he's got books to help you with your life

But there's no need to worry, this is just a vacation
It's not permanent leaving, every kid gets excited
When his parents are yelling 'cause they ordered a Lincoln

And they received a compact and there's fat nuns and tenors
Who are blocking departures till I'm birthed from their vulvas
And I kiss you and hug you, you remember our forfeits

And you shout at the platform, "Here we come, mister airplane
Here we come, mister airplane, here we come, mister airplane
Here we come, mister airplane"
