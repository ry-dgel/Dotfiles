Stacking higher brick by brick
Pretend we are inside of it
Pieces set and set aside
Back into the line outside
All along wait out the day
Shrug and lay the dreams away
A wall within and wall without
Horizon closing in around
Desert creeps in every year
Young we wait in quiet fear
In cracks, an aperture array
Escape into a stellar way
Rays, I was one
Floods, I was one
