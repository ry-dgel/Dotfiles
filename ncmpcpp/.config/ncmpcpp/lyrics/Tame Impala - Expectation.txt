Everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love
Stuck on thinking that there is always something to lose
Or a hit from above, a hit from above
I don't need what I'm holding on to, I wish I knew but meanwhile

Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
'Cause everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love

And then I will escape, I'll never ever have to see
Another disappointed face, no one to please
Every now and then, it feels like, in all of the universe 
There is nobody for me
I told myself I wouldn't care, no I wouldn't care
But when she said she'd come 'round
I combed my hair, yes I checked my hair
Oh, meanwhile, meanwhile, meanwhile

Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations is making me feel old
Expectation is taking it's toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul...
