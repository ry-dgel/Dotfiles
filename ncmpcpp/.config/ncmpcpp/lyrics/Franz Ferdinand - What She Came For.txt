I've got a question for ya
I've got a question for ya
Where did you get your name from?
Where did you get your name from?

I've got a question for ya
Where do you see yourself 
In five minutes time?

With a laugh like that
Or a look like that
You make us all feel gauche
Like it's a smutty joke, but

With a laugh like that
Or a move like that
You make us all just go 
La, la, la, la

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
Knows what she came for
No question, no doubt, woah

You're what she came for

I've got a question for ya
Another question for ya
How do you feel the-
How do you feel the pressure?

Why you're wearing what you're wearing
Where will your life be gone
In five minutes, five?

So say something stupid
You know that you'd love to

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
Knows what she came for
No question, no doubt

Woah
You're what she came for, woah
You're what she came for, woah

You're what she came for
