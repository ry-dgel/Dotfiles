The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrive I thought I saw you leaving carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you replied

"Why'd you only call me when you're high?
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Somewhere darker talking the same shite
I need a partner (high), well "Are you out tonight?"
It's harder and harder to get you to listen more I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisons and having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you replied (message you replied)

"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

And I can't see you here wonder where I might
It sorta feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found what I was hoping to find
You said you "Gotta be up in the morning gonna have an early night"
And "You're starting to bore me baby, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
