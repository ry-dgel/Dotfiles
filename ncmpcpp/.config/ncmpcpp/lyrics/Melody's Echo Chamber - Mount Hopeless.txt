I hope that you don't stop to use the fallen sounds I found in you 

As it goes I can't explain, why you feel so uncertain? 
And as it stands and fades away on the hopeful day it does the same 
As it goes I can't explain, why you feel so uncertain? 
And as it stands and fades away on the hopeful day it's all the same

I dare to find you never truth but on the calm I find my truth 

As it goes I can't explain, why you feel so uncertain?
And as it stands and fades away on the hopeful day it does the same
As it goes I can't explain, why you feel so uncertain?
And as it stands and fades away on the hopeful day it's not the same
