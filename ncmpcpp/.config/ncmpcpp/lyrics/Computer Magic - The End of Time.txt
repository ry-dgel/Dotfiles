People walking by us as we pass
y headphones on and
y sunglasses
        
         
         walkin' 'round I'm only roaming
ry to find my own way home and
 
         

can you give me a reason?
can you give me a sign?
can you give me a signal?

and the city is freezin'
but you're all mine
don't care about other people

can we live,
can we live
a little longer?
just a little longer?
is it ending soon?
can I be with you
another day?
another day?

the world is ending
way too fast
most things this good
they never last
faces floating by me
alone
I'll try to find my way home and
can you give back my friends?
can you give me that excuse?
I know they're trying to pretend
that they're not just like all of them
I don't think it's any use

can you give me a good heart?
can you give me a nice day?
can you get rid of the the news?

cause we all need a fresh start
cause we all need a long stay
cause we're all so confused

can we live?
can we live
a little longer?
just a little longer?
is it ending soon?
can I be with you
another day?
just another day?
