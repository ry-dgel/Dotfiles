Es-so, es-soPudding pie andEs-so, es-so          
           Do or die and
Es-so, es-so
A baby's cry
I gotta do right if my body's tight, right?

Es-so, es-so
A piece of bacon
Walk a mile round the lake and
Crunches, still on they climb up high
I gotta do right if my body's tight, right?

Sometimes I've got the jungle under my skin
Drive up the rhythms, stick a fucking fork in
Bathe it all in a wave of disgust
'I can't believe I ate the whole thing'

Es-so, es-so
Me and you
Love each other through and through
It is true, Daddy
It is true, Daddy
I'm running over my body with my own car

Es-so, Es-so
Feelin' free
