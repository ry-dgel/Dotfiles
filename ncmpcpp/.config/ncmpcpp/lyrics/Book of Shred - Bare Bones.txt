remove that need 
he orchids thrive 
n the dark 
         
           i found the night awake 

we found dried leaves 
pressed inside the book 
like a stark vision of time 
i wish you were still alive 

and will the memories be lost 
when we lose you 
when they clear the house 
you lived so many years 

no matter how far you are away 
i see you in the distance 
the distance 

we spit in the pond to give the fish something to pray to 

sometimes the sunset doesn't want to be photographed 
we are no tigers in the picked-bone grasslands 
ela dear knows a dork in a thrift store hat 
and that is that.

most of deez emcees is fake.
