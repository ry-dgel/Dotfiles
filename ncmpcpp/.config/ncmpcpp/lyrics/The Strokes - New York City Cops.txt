Here in the streets of American nights
Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
Studied all the rules, and I want no part
But I let you in just to break this heart
Even though it was only one night
It was fucking strange

Nina's in the bedroom
She says "Time to go now"
But leavin', it ain't easy
I've got to let go
Oh, I've got to let go
And the hours, they ran slow
I said, every night, she just can't stop saying

"New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart"

Oh, kill me now 'cause I'll let you down
I swear one day we're gonna leave this town
Stop
Yes, I'm leaving 'cause this just won't work
Oh, they act like Romans but they dress like Turks
Soft time, in your prime
See, me, I like the summertime
But hey

Nina's in the bedroom
She says "Time to go now"
Oh, leavin', it ain't easy
Oh, I've got to let go
I've got to let go
Oh, trapped in an apartment
She would not let them get her
She wrote it in a letter
Oh, "I've got to come clean
The authorities, they've seen"
Darling, I'm somewhere in between
I said, every night, she just can't stop saying

"New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart"
