Hey there girl with the broken eyes
Ain't my love been true?
Ain't no need to act surprised
When it comes back to you
When it comes back to you

The wind blows high and the wind blows low
Long as I have known
Everything that blows away
Soon is gonna come back home
Soon is gonna come back home

Standing there in your raven hair
Acting like you don't know
Lips that launched a thousand ships
That's where my money goes
Where my money goes

I know they say I'll rue the day
I gave you a piece of my heart
It's do re mi and dust to dust
Soon we all must part
Soon we all must part

So, hey there girl with the broken eyes
Ain't my love been true
Ain't no need to act surprised
When it comes back to you
When it comes back to you

The wind blows high and the wind blows low
Long as I have known
And everything that blows away
Soon is gonna come back home
Soon is gonna come back home
Soon is gonna come back home
Soon is gonna come back home
