I woke up one morning
All my fingers rotting
I woke up a dying man
Without a chance

I came to your window
Threw a stone and waited
At the door, a stranger stood
The stranger's voice said nothing good
I turned to walk the frozen ground
Alone, all the way home

Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn

Both my eyes are fading
No light in the evening
Planted like a seed in sand
Or drowned in rain

Watch you for an hour
He kept you beneath him
He kept you on lock and key
He paid the wage you sent to me
And wastes the day so idlly
Alone, all the way home

Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn

Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn
