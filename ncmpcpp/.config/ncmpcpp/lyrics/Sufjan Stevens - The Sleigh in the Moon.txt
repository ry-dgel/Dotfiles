We wait in our beds
Tight under the sheets
Just peeking our heads
We've waited for weeks
I can't go to sleep
I tried counting sheep
It's coming so soon
The sleigh in moon

I'm holding my breath
I can't keep it yet
No, we won't forget
We know that we're blessed
We know that we're blessed
We know that we're blessed
