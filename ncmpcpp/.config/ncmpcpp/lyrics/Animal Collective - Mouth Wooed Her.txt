I started playing the game and liked the game

Good day, assassinate a
Tribe of lice of mine and yours
You're so good and natural
My arms are peeling 'cause you're so
Close to bite, I'm dying my face
So I can take you out at breakfast time

Yes you're nice, not nice at school but
All so violent, all so sure
I can figure it out, I think I have
Can we be patient, time for a nap
And now if I could just fix the clock
I'd take you out at breakfast time

I don't want no one no
I don't want none agua
I don't want one of that
I don't want none of no
I don't want no one no
I don't want one of the
I don't want no one no
I don't want no one no

I've been thinking better not
Better chance with better rosary
Words are pudding, if they won't look out
Can we get dressed? Now let's all go out
Oh let's the dye on my face is topping
All the cakes at breakfast time

Better drink it all if I can have it
I need mouth water
Better drink it all if I can have it
I need mouth water
Better drink it all if I can have it
I need mouth water
Better drink it all if I can have it
I need mouth water
Better drink it all if I can have it
I need mouth water
Better drink it all if I can have it
I need mouth water
