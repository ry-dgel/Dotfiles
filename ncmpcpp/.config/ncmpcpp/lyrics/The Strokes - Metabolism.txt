I wanna be outrageous
But inside, I know I'm plain
So plain

Just plain
Boring and plain

Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone, I guess
Tryin' for the perfect life
End up bein' in denial

I wanna be somebody
Wanna be somebody like you
Like you
Like you

Like you
Instead of me

Silently Obsessed with death
Just like anyone, I guess
Tryin' for the perfect life
End up being in denial
