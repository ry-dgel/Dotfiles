I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas day in the morning.

And what was in those ships all three?
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
And what was in those ships all three?
On Christmas day in the morning.

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas day in the morning.
