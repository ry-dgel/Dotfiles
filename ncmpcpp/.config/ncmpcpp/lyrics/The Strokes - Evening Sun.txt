They love you or they hate you
But they will never let you be
They thrill you or sedate you
But they will never let you see

In the evening sun

Encourage and derange you
Watch you walking scared along
Despite intimidation
Pleased to watch you dance alone

In the evening sun

Go your seperate way now
Someday you'll come back
And I'll be dreaming I was sunburned
I don't wanna break your heart in
Break your heart in two halves
Keep one half and give one half to me
I like the summer, miss the summer
Tell me, what'd you do?
Nothing?
Me too

Oh, actors they're pretending
And singers they will sometimes lie
Oh, kids are always honest
'Cause they don't think they're ever gonna die
You're the prettiest smartest captain of the team
I love you more than being seventeen

In the evening sun
