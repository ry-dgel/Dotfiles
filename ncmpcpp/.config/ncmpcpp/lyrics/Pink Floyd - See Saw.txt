Marigolds are very much in love
But he doesn't mind
Picking up sister
He makes his way in to the see-saw land
All the way up she smiles
She goes up while he goes down, down

Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister's throwing stones hoping for a hit
He doesn't know, so then
She goes up while he goes down, down

Another time, another day
A brother's way to leave
Another time, another day, day, day, day

She's selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon
Picking up weeds
She hasn't got time to care
All can see he's not there
She grows up for another man, and he's down

Another time, another day
A brother's way to leave
Another time, another day, day, day, day

Another time, another day
A brother's way to leave
