Don't speak your golden dreamsYou once had a chanceto make things right         
         
         Go now, your friend's in need  
         
When you call they're gone
So sad, so sad
So hopeless

Don't seek your golden dreams
There's no time
You know this time it's over

Acting on regrets

Acting on regrets

Go now, your friend's in need
When you call they're gone
So sad, so sad
So hopeless

Don't seek your golden dreams
There's no time
You know this time it's over

Acting on regrets
