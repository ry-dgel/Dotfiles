Now I’m not talking from experience
But I think I’ve found magnificence
And at the end of the day
You can be hard work but you’re good for me
And though you seem to make my body ache
It’s a feeling I appreciate
Which makes it easier when
You can be hard work but you’re good for me
 
This time I know I won’t be proved wrong
This time to win you gotta lose some
Sometimes I just wanna give you up right away
But then you go and brighten up my day
 
I know I’m not wasting my time
For you to be the reason I cry
And no I’m not gonna lie
You’re hard work but you’re good for me
And you’re the one that’s by my side
When I’m going out of my mind
But ninety nine per cent of the time
You’re hard work but you’re good for me
 
And when I’m losing all my energy
You’re like my only working remedy
And when I struggle to breathe
Its ‘cause your hard work but you’re good for me
And when I start to feel I’ve had enough
And my head is feeling kind of rough
And even thinking is tough
When you’re hard work but you’re good for me
 
This high is a feeling that I’m fixed on
I knew it was worth it in the long run
‘Cause somehow everything has fell into place
And you can tell by the smile on my face
 
I know I’m not wasting my time
For you to be the reason I cry
And no I’m not gonna lie
You’re hard work but you’re good for me
And you’re the one that’s by my side
When I’m going out of my mind
But ninety nine per cent of the time
You’re hard work but you’re good for me
 
Mmm, hard work
Mmm, hard work
Mmm, you’re hard work but you’re good for me
Mmm, hard work
Mmm, hard work
Mmm, you’re hard work but you’re good for me
But I’m not running away, no
A little bit of love is all it takes
 
I know I’m not wasting my time
For you to be the reason I cry
And no I’m not gonna lie
You’re hard work but you’re good for me
And you’re the one to be by my side
When I’m going out of my mind
But ninety nine per cent of the time
You’re hard work but you’re good for me
 
Mmm, hard work
Mmm, hard work
Mmm, you’re hard work but you’re good for me
Mmm, hard work
Mmm, hard work
Mmm, you’re hard work but you’re good for me
