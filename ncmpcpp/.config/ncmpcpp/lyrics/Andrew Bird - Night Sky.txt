Sound is a wave, like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violin
Pushing and pulling from shore to shore
Biggest melody you never heard before

[CHORUS]
If I were the night sky
Here’s my lullaby
Lullaby to leave by
If I were the night

What if we hadn’t been born at the same time?
What if you’re seventy five and I were nine?
Would I come visit you?
Bring you cookies in an old folks home?
Would you be there alone?

And when the late summer lightning
Fires off in your arms
Will I remember to breathe?
No, I never will, no
And the fire could convince you that I mean you no harm
Just wanna show you how not to need

[CHORUS]

What if we hadn’t been each other at the same time?
Would you tell me all the stories
From when you were young and in your prime?
Would I rock you to sleep?
Would you tell me all the secrets you don’t need to keep?
Would I still miss you?
Oh, would you then
Have been mine?

Sound is a wave, like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violin
Pushing and pulling from shore to shore
Biggest melody you never heard before

[CHORUS]
