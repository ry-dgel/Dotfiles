His father was a drinker and his mother cried in bed
Folding John Wayne's T-shirts when the swingset hit his head
The neighbors they adored him for his humor and his conversation
Look underneath the house there
Find the few living things rotting fast in their sleep of the dead
Twenty-seven people, even more
They were boys with their cars, summer jobs, oh my God
Ooh, are you one of them?

He dressed up like a clown for them with his face paint white and red
And on his best behavior in a dark room on the bed, he kissed them all
He'd kill ten thousand people
With a sleight of his hand, running far, running fast to the dead
He took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips, quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth

And in my best behavior, I am really just like him
Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid
