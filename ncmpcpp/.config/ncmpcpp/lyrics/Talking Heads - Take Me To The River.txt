I don't know why I love you like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet
And I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay

Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Dip me in the water, washing me down
Washing me down

I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret
I wanna know can you tell me
I'd love to stay

Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Dip me in the water, washing me down

Washing me
Hold me, squeeze me
Love me, tease me
'Til I can't, 'til I can't
'Til I can't, I can't take no more

Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Dip me in the water
Drop me to the river
Dip me in the water
Drop me in the river
Push me in the water, washing me down
Washing me down

I don't know why I love you like I do
All the trouble you put me through
Sixteen candles blown on my wall
And am I the biggest fool of them all
I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay

Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Dip me in the water
Drop me to the river
Dip me in the water
Drop me in the river
Drop me in the water, washing me down
Washing me down
