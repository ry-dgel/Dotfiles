I saw you in the lane next to me
You were doing freestyle, then you switched it around
To a little bit of backstroke
I couldn't see underneath
Your swimming cap, but it appeared that you had
Dark colored hair, maybe it was blonde for all I know
I had goggles on
They were getting foggy
I much prefer swimming to jogging

I tried my very best to impress you
Held my breath longer than I normally do
I was getting dizzy
My hair was wet and frizzy
Felt my muscles burn, I took a tumble turn
For the worse, it's a curse
My lack of athleticism, sunk like a stone
Like a first owner's home loan
When I came to, you and your towel were gone
