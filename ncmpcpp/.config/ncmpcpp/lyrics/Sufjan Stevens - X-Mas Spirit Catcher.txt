The angel came and said its name
But she could not keep from trembling
The spirit went where it went
Though it could not cede forgiveness

And when it came to pass again
Enterprising in its legend
The government did all it could
To be sure its power was given

To see yourself
What have you done with yourself?
Have you missed it?
To be of life, in living it
Love in fullness, life worth living

To understand the Son of Man
For the vision is the ending
In Israel, of sacrifice
Indignation is the mending

Blessed is the woman
For to be called fullness
Blessed is the woman
For to be called fullness

And Gabriel, in spite of it
Went for wandering in the desert
The Holy One is born of it
Mary and her cousin ever

Blessed is the woman
For to be called fullness
Blessed is the woman
For to be called fullness
