Here now, long gone, three freaks in a Vanagon
Went to the river, but the river got drowned
All the good people were hangin' around

Too little, too late, everybody gotta medicate
Through the winter when the winter comes down
Or this city 'comes a hangin' ground

But, I'm not goin' on just to sing another summersong
So long, farewell, don't everybody fall all over themselves

But, I'm not goin' on just to sing another summersong
So long, farewell, don't everybody fall all over themselves

But, I'm not goin' on just to sing another sing-along suicide song
So long, farewell, don't everybody fall all over themselves
So don't everybody fall all over themselves
So don't everybody fall all over themselves
