Oh no, it's nighttime
Makes me sad
Whaddit I done in the daytime?
Where am I out in the nighttime?

Going crazy at the funny ball
They are dancing at the wrong mall
With the right girl and the low and mine
And they left the stall

And it's daytime, ease and let me in
I love when we come and it's good so
And it cures stress too and it blows your mind
It's a neat time any wish now
We've got free hands, go and need hands
Is where we were out takin' these times

It's a good day for a new call
Where we come to say that I need ya
And I need ya when I need ya
And I need ya when we need ya
Do I need ya? Yeah I need ya
Do I need ya?
