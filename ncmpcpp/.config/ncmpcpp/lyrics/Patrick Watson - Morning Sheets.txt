Underneath the morning sheets
My skin is tangled in between
Sun is peaking through the blanket holes
Don't you wish you were there?

Just before you open up your eyes
Our legs are wrapped around our sides
My lips are gently walking
Don't you wish you were there?

Wish you were there?
Don’t you wish you were there?
Don’t you wish you were there?
Don’t you wish you were there?
Don’t you wish you were there?
Don’t you wish you were there?
Wish you were there?
Don’t you wish you were there?
