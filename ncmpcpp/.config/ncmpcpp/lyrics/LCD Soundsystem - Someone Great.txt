I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new I could have started
Too late for beginnings

The very little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way we used to argue
Locked in your basement

I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised, as it's early
And that should be your perfect warning
That something's a problem

To tell the truth I saw it coming
The way you were breathing
But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end

The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm sad, it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because, what's the difference?

There's all the work that needs to be done
It's late for revision
There's all the time and all the planning
And songs to be finished

And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
Till the day, it stops

And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
Till the day, it stops

And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
Till the day, it stops

And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming
Till the day, it stops

I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings

You're smaller than my wife imagined
Surprised you were human
There shouldn't be this radio silence
But what are the options?

When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone
When someone great is gone

We're safe for the moment
Saved for the moment
