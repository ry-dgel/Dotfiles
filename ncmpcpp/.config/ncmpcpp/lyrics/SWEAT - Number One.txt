Ooh baby, give it to me now, girl

Can't nobody give it out
For me and you, yeah, girl
I wanna pull down the shades and the lights
And do what I wanna do to hear it girl

You can tell me now baby
I can't keep trying to play nice together
Oh girl before the night is over
I bet, I bet I can make you sweat

You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat
You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat

If you let me kiss you here and now
I'll do anything you want me to
I wanna drive you wild, baby
Let me tell you, let me drive you wild, babe

You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat
You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat

All alone tonight, just me and you
I wanna do you right
And baby that's what I wanna do
Just put your arms in the air
And I'll kiss you everywhere

You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat
You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat

Come on baby
You're doing something to me baby
You're doing something real to me baby
[?]

Yes, ooh yes, I say yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, please yes, oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

Make you sweat all night long, girl
Yeah, just you and me, come on
Just right now, baby, let's do it now
Come on, come on baby, come on let's do it now
Right now, baby, you, you, you all night long, girl

You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat
