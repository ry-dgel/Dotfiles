In your arms I feel right at home,
That's the feeling I ain't felt before.
If you're feeling the same way then let me know,
Cause there's nothing worse than being in love alone.

Is it true that I'm not the only one?
Is it true that you're just having fun with my heart?
I need an answer
Is it true
Is it true

You're my Angel that was sent to earth.
In your eyes I see my future.
I can't be without you so it's got to work.
Goodbyes not an option so don't say a word.

Is it true that I'm not the only one?
Is it true that you're just having fun with my heart?
I need an answer
Is it true
Is it true

I've never been a victim of love before
So I'm not sure what I should be looking for
But I know the signs are in my face
Hope it's not to late to change
Your mind and make you wanna stay

Is it true that I'm not the only one?
Is it true that you're just having fun with my heart?
I need an answer
Is it true
Is it true

Is it true that I'm not the only one?
Is it true that you're just having fun with my heart?
I need an answer
Is it true
Is it true

If you just can't tell me the truth
it wasn't real when you said I love you.
