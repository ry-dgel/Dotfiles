You're much too young
To be a part of me
Too young
To get a hold on me

You're much too young
You're much too young
You're much too young
To mess around with me

Hey, you know I've met a lot of cool chicks
But I've never met a girl with all her own teeth
That's why I love you babe, that's why we could be
But you're too young, too young

The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter

The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter

The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter

Hey, sophisticated lady
You know I've met a lot of cool chicks
But you've got style, you've got class
But most of all, you've got love technique
