Dig count Basie 
Blow Joe's blues away
Every night, every noon, every sun, every moon

Yeah
Every way
Yeah
Everywhere
Yeah
I get the blues
Yeah
And I don't care
Yeah

I run away and hide
But find they follow me there
You run away and hide
But find they follow you there
There, well get up

Yeah
Get fed up and they'll let up
Dig
Get up and go now
Let up and blow now
You give them their way everyday
Yes, every doggone day
You're singing the blues each time I see ya

Every day
You're singing the blues
Those blues won't free ya
Every day
I sort of expected
Once you'd shake'em
Every day
But now I can dig
They're what you make them
Every day 
What about it?
Soon as I'm wakin'
Everyday I have the blues
Every dawnin' I dig
They're waitin' there to wig me
Every day
What about it?

Oh
Everyday I have the blues
What are you gonna get but blue
Wish that I could help you
Baby, what can I do?
When you see me worried baby
I've had a few
Because it's you I'd hate to lose
What about settlin'
How're you gonna keep 'em from meddlin'?
You should be movin'
Nobody loves me

Oh 
You need some groovin'
Nobody seems to care
The blues have gone their bit- Yeah!
Baby don't seem to care
Her lovin' cupboard is bare

Nobody loves me
Your troubles growin'
You should be goin'
Nobody seems to care
The blues have won, that's it yeah
How're you gonna get her to care?

Gotta be a millionaire
Speaking of bad luck
Luck and trouble
And you know I've had my share
The day they metcha
You let them getcha
So now you might as well split, yeah

Yes man, I'm diggin', you tell me
I'm gonna pack my suitcase
I hear ya talkin'

Although she's hurtin'

No one to love
