One mother rises
Pulling the sheets from the crib
All the disguises
Wandering stars, what she did
All the kings horns, all the kings horns
Saddled and worn
Raise the dead
Holy and infant
He came to raise up the dead

Wandering wisemen
What did you bring to his bed
Shapeless surprises
Incense to bring to the dead
Nothing is wrong, it's what she did
All the kings horns and kings men 
Nothing is wrong its what she did
All the kings horns and kings men

Nothing is wrong its what she did
All the kings horns raise the dead
Nothing is wrong its what she did
All the kings horns
