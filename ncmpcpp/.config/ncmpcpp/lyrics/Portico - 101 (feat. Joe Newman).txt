As I lay lying to the limit of my chain
I stand and pivot a perfect circle
Mauve, midnight blue, brown, and purple
Your fading gift that remains

With a temperature of 103
That's the temperature my cheek can leave
G a s o l i n e
G a s o l i n e
G a s o l i n e
G a s o l i n e

Though my fever so captive for so long
Somersaults underwater
Or walking through the ground as lava

With a temperature of 103
That's the temperature my cheek can leave

Forgive and shut up ratchet it up once again
A soul now entered my fear monger
3 laden hounds lead in hunger

With a temperature of 103
The three beasts are released on me

See me run, they dance, I fall, we sing
See me run, they dance, I fall, we sing
Now although I know nothing is so
G a s o l i n e

See me run, they dance, I fall, we sing
See me run, they dance, I fall, we sing
Now although I know nothing is so
G a s o l i n e
G a s o l i n e
G a s o l i n e
