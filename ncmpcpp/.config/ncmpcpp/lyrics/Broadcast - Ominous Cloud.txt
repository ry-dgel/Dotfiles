oh let me sail away
on the beach and on the earth
the boats on the sea are blissfully freee 
they will come to no harm
cuz the waves are so calm

oh let me think a while 
to the playground of your smile
the wind through the flame
whistles your name
though you said good bye 
you did not leave my mind

oh i've got to get away
from this town don't want to face
the ominous clouds

but not now 
not now 
not now

i've got to find a place
be myself and learn to face 
the ominous clouds

but not now 
not now 
not now

i want to sail away
want to look back on the day
and hide with my hand 
what's left of the land
though I leave it behind
it will not leave my mind

oh i've got to get away
from this town don't want to face
the ominous clouds

oh not now 
not now 
not now

i've got to find a place
be myself and learn to face 
the ominous clouds

but not now 
not now 
not now
