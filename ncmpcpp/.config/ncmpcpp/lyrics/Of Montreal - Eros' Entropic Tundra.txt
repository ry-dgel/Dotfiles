All I ever get is sad love
While watching all my friends find their happy love
I don't understand why I should be without love

All I ever get is sad love
Always falling for the ones who feel nothing for me
Sometimes I think I should just forget about love

I was walking with my parents through St. Peter's Park
When I saw a young couple with a child
They were all holding hands and smiling
They seemed very nice
Seemed to have a nice life

All I ever get is sad love
Feeling incomplete and below being loved
I don't know why it has been so hard to find love

All I ever get is sad love
The unrequited kind is all I have procured
And it was nothing at all like what I've heard about love

Without love, life has no great reward
Leaving us damaged or feeling so bored
Devoid of memories, nothing to record
Wishing the one that we adore
Loved us more

All I ever get is sad love

I was walking with my parents through St. Peter's Park
When I saw a young couple with a child
They were all holding hands and smiling
They seemed very nice
Seemed to have a nice life

All I ever get is sad love
Always falling for the ones who feel nothing for me
Sometimes I think I should just forget about love

Sad love (Sad love, sad love, sad love)
