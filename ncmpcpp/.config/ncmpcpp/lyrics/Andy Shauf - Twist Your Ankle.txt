Last night
Dancing slow and turning white(?)
With you caught in my eye
I'll twist your ankle with my sight(?)

Goodnight
I'll toss (?)
Laugh with all your friends
Oh i don't really understand them

Everybody's laughing at me
Just let me walk home

Oh god
Stumble over to the door
Trashed and out of line
Oh i don't think the fault is all mine
Last night dancing slow and turning white(?)
I watched you walk right by
Twist my ankle
Stay by your side

Everybody's laughing at me
I can't make a sound

Everybody's laughing at me
I wish i just stayed home
