Captured under hypnosis, faster and faster images
Can a meaning be obtained or this mystery explained

I'm in orbit held by magnet
And the force fields so much closer than love

Logic offers no defence underneath this influence
While this puzzle of intent holds emotion in suspense

I'm in orbit held by magnet
And the force fields so much closer than love

Caught between the day and night
And a knot that pulls too tight

I'm in orbit held by magnet
And the force fields so much closer than love
