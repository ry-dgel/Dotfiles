Ain't no line around the corner, no security,
No velvet rope, no dress code, everybody's VIP,
You can wear your hat, dance in your bare feet,
No credit card, no roll of cash, just BYOB

Woah oh oh, chillin' on a back porch
Little hottie swingin' up in the swings
Them good ol' boys pickin' six strings
Woah oh oh, leave your trouble at the door
No cover charge, get in for free
No last call, let's party on a back porch
(Chillin' on the back porch, oh yeah
Chillin' on the back porch, oh yeah)

Got a tin roof on the top just in case it rains
Got a kiddy pool off the deck for those hot as hell days
Got beer on ice, all day all night,
Now if that sounds like something you like come on

Woah oh oh, chillin' on a back porch
Little hottie swingin' up in the swings
Them good ol' boys pickin' six strings
Woah oh oh, leave your trouble at the door
No cover charge, get in for free
No last call, let's party on a back porch
[x3]

On a back porch
Little hottie swingin' up in the swings
Them good ol' boys pickin' six strings
No cover charge, get in for free
No last call, so let's party on a back porch
See ya on the back porch
