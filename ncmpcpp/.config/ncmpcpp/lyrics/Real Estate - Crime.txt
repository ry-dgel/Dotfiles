Toss and turn all night
Don't know how to make it right
Crippling anxiety

This crowd was growing old
If I may be so bold
Will you go straight with me?

I don't wanna die
Lonely and uptight
Stay with me
All will be revealed

I remember when
This all felt like pretend
And I still can't believe

Sprung you from your hole
With everything you own
As if you weren't already free

I don't wanna die
Lonely and uptight
Stay with me
Oh I will be with you

I don't wanna die
Lonely in the time
Stay with me
Oh I will be with you
