I hope to God he'll keep my boogie
And sweep it right from under my bed
I'll melt cause I ain't got the money fo' always livin right under my bed
Oh my hopes do set on some company (pretty incomprehensible here)
To keep it all under my head
Tell them get on call the daddy
In another while you're splittin my head (2nd time)
I do hope to God he'll keep my boogies
But God don't even care
Still tell everybody boogie boogie
Nada nada bauga nada nada murder (2x)
boogie boogie all under my bed
nada nada bauga nada nada murder
