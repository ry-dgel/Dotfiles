We had a white and blackish Sheltie had a name when we first got him
I wish I had taken better care of him but he had it okay
I'm sorry when I get unruly
When you carry on so much I get a little tired

I hope you get over your teething, it's not easy when you feel sick
He had a sprightly walk you'd like him when he'd keep up along your side
"Wrap your peckers," what he told us
Me and mike looked at each other like whoa what was that then

Derek never woke up at night and in the morning he's ready to go
And he never had a voice like you to scream with when he wanted something
I should have been so much more willing
To help out with all the things that a dog like you needed

What do you what do you, what do you, what do you
What do you what do you, what do you, what do you
See when you, see when you, see when you, see when you
See when you, see when you, see when you, see when you
See inside of me of me of me of me of me of me of me of me
See inside of me of me of me of me of me of me of me of me

You can count, you can count, you can count, you can count
You can count, you can count, you can count, you can count
When you count, when you count, when you count, when you count
When you count, when you count, when you count, when you count
Count on me, count on me, count on me, count on me
Count on me, count on me, count on me, count on me

What do you what do you, what do you, what do you
What do you what do you, what do you, what do you
See when you, see when you, see when you, see when you
See when you, see when you, see when you, see when you
See inside of me of me of me of me of me of me of me of me
See inside of me, ide of me, ide of me, ide of me
Ide of me, ide of me, ide of
