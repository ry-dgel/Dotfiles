I've been thinking about youand I know it's not fairI can't go on without you         
         
         And I know you don't care  
         
I had dreams but they left me
Is that all they're good for
And then you saw the best in me
It's like you opened the door

And I can't understand why
We've never met before
I'll just wait here on standby
Lying on dirty floors
I just can't live without you
But of course I can try
There's just something about you
And I don't know what

Is this romance I'm feeling
Is this love at first sight
I've never written a love song
But I Thought I just might

I don't know you very well
And you don't know me
I guess we maybe, might as well
Might as well let things be

And I can't understand why
We've never met before
I'll just wait here on standby
Lying on dirty floors
I just can't live without you
But of course I can try
There's just something about you
And I don't know what
