Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
I get all confused when you mix up the dates, woah

Don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
And you stay for the week
You say that you hate it but that's how you made it
Just to keep it oblique

We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We're all suh-suh-suh sucked-in-by parlour tricks

Oh the people deceive you the kids never leave
'Cause you make them at home
You try to appease them and they show you the stick
But still you pick up the phone

But hey man, you can take it
As long as they don't shove you out in the cold
It's not getting better, no it's not getting better, man
It's just getting old

And ah ooh
We do what we're programmed to do
Hey we do what we're told
Ah woo-hoo

I never remember to carry my book when I get on the bus
You never forget, but it's your time to collect
When they are making a fuss

We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We're all high high high, high high on wiggling hips

And ah ooh
You break off your plans for the weekend
And ah ooh
You can tell them the dates
But that don't mean they're letting you go
Ah woo-hoo
Yeah
Ah woo-hoo

Don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
And you stay for the year
Avoid all the plans 'cause we're making our day jobs
Into a steady career

We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We all claw claw claw, cli-climb onto sinking ships

And ah ooh
Avoid all the cold sideways glances
And ah ooh
Celebrate! Celebrate! Celebrate!
And then turn to stone

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
You turn 25 and now you're all out of escapes, c'mon

Hey the rock writer told me to tell you:
"Though you're great and you're brave
You still lack that which makes you a star."

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
We all get a little drunk and then we act like apes, show

Wow, wow
