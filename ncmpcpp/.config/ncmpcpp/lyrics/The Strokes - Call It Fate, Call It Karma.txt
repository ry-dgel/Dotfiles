Close the door
Not all the way
He don’t understand
We don’t understand

So don't you remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run in their place

Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around and oh no
You are are not around
I needed more time watching you

You got it down, why don't you?
I wanted to understand your place
So don't you wanna remind me?
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run in their place

Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around and oh no
You are not around
I needed more time watching you
Watching you..

I needed someone
I needed someone
