You live in a cave, one made of drapes
Your hint? of perfume from your personal maid
Whose scrubs make her arms look too big for her frame
For the life of me I can't remember her name
I'm praying to speak, accept myself
And most use prayers to keep a good health

You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die

I live in a fog, one that's foremade
While my physical body's turning in my grave
The spirit's forgiven, building in your brain
But it doesn't know how
I reach my arm across the bed and hold your hand
The angel of state can't wait to seize all your land

You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die

You weren't there when I needed
You are gone, you're going under

You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
You'll never die, you'll never die
