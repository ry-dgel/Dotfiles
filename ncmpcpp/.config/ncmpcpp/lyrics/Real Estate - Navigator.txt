We stare at the shadows on the sidewalk
They're moving on flowers rendered in chalk
The day is young but I'm already spent
I have no idea where that time went

Cross the kitchen floor
Steal out the back door
Past the monument
I'll meet you where the pavement ends

Cross the kitchen floor
Steal out the back door
Past the monument
I'll meet you where the pavement ends

I stare at the hands on the clock
I'm still waiting for them to stop
The earliest light is just shining in
And I've no idea where the day's been
