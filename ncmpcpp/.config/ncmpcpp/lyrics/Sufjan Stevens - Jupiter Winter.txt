Oh Father Christmas,
Come to us, come to us
Perfect and with us, 
Come to us, come to us

Oh Mother Mary,
Celebrate, celebrate
Brave sanctuary,
Come to us, come to us

Explorations end in Christ,
Decorations left behind,
Where will you go, where will you go,
where will you go?
Troubled heart, troubled heart, here with all

Oh Christian winter,
Call to us, call to us
Jupiter Winter,
Regulus, Regulus

Oh star of wisdom,
Light of life, light of life
Casperous prism,
Bride of life, bride of life

Disappointment to be had,
Hold your temper too my friend,
Where will you go, where will you go, where will you go?
Troubled heart, troubled heart, here with all
