When I was young
Coach called me the tiger
I always had
A knack with the danger

Living in fear in the year of the tiger [X2]

Italian shoes
Like these rubes know the difference
Suitcase of cash
In the back of my stick shift
I had to be the best of the bourgeoisie
And my kingdom for a cup of coffee

Living in fear in the year of the tiger [X4]

Oh America
Can I owe you one
Oh America
Can I owe you one
Oh America
Can I owe you one
Oh America
Can I owe you one

Living in fear in the year of the tiger [X4]
