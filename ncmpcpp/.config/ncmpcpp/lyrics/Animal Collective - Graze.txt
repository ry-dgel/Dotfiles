Let me begin
Feels good 'cause it's early
Ease open my eyes
And let light in

Some ideas are brewing
The radio abides
With flying string
Old ideas worth doing
Are taking their time

Fine
Let's not hurry
It's our morning
(Spread out)
Let's not worry
It's our morning
(Spread out)

How does a band
Turn into such a dream
If I had a hand
What would you say about?
What's in my face
That warrants all this sass
And to have a band
That cracks the point of fame
(To be in the city)
Why does a band make me
Less settled in
Rounding up my friends,
We might not feel so bad
(To be in the city)
Once in a while
I'll think of you to smile
Some daydreams marked
By many little strikes out
(To be in the city)

(Let me begin)

Comfort, comfort
Why do you run for it?
Why can't you keep doing
What you're supposed to do?

Why can't I reach you?
When I most need you
You're at the beach and
I'm in some strange bed

Comfort, comfort
Why do you run for it?
Why can't you keep doing
What you're supposed to do?

Why do you have to go?
Why do you have to go?
I'm in the dark unknown
And you're staying home

(Let me begin)
