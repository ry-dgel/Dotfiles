Actor, but never for stage or screen
In a cauldron of crime
Did she want him or want to be him?
And did she smoke a cigarette in the dark?

Actor, but never for stage or screen
Acting like you’ve never seen

Every cell of hers more alive and bright than mine
Did she want me or want to be me
And did she smoke a cigarette in the dark?

Actor, but never for stage or screen
Acting like you’ve never seen

La la la

Actor, but never for stage or screen
Acting like you’ve never seen
