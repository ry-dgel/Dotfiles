Twelve steps in to your backyard
Through tall green grass, and into the world
Ain't it feel right
Ain't it feel nice
In your own backyard

A dirty winding road, around your feet
That carries me along and into the beat
Didn't need to go so far
You found what you were thirsting for
I didn't need to go so far
To find what you were looking for
Because you were always beside
Just right behind
Right off the hand
You just didn't know
It was there in your own backyard

Twelve steps in to your backyard
Twelve steps in to your backyard
Twelve steps in to your backyard
Twelve steps in to your backyard
