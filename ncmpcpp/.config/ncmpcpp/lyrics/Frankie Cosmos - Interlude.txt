Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, can't call it

[J. Cole:]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

Tables do turn and labels do burn, the second that they ask you to sell your soul
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say "Fuck that shit" and be bold
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again, at least you will know
The end of your rope was chose by you and not companies
Who control our remote control and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me, I'm just high again, smokin' weed to get by again
No, actually I'm lyin' cause smokin' it got me smilin'
Rhyming like I rhyme, way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool, momma sorry, I just stopped tryin'
Paid for your house in hopes there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am, cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and then pull up and just start firin'
Niggas murkin' each other, n murky water I try and swim
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you about some diamond?
Said all I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement

Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better off not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)
