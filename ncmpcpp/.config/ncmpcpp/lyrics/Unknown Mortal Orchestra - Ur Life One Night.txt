If she’d fallen in love, first blood, you didn’t notice
It’s not love, it’s a close call
You poor thing you’ve got
To stop calling it love
You’ve got to be ignorin'
The first girl
She’s so clever
She said

She could be the love of your life
Just for one night

She wants you, and love don’t come into the equation
What she loves, is sex in parked cars and the Photo Booth at Cha Cha
She’s not a hologram, got damn, you can’t ignore it
She’s such fun
She says “don’t run”, she says

She could be the love of your life
Just for one night

You’re cornered, and she just needs revolution
That’s cute, but she’s no pearl of Gisborne

She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
