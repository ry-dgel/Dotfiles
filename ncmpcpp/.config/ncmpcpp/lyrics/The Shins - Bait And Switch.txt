I finally had all my ducks in a row
Peace and quiet by means of subtraction
How she got in, I'm not sure that I know
But two weeks on and my spine was in traction, my eyes in a basket

My gut and my heart are so out of phase
And that kind of girl, she ain't nobody's daughter
I’m just not used to these powerful waves
She's shining the brass and I’m taking on water
What am I to do now?

I call on a beautiful witch with a moral compass
Bait and switch

Hide from my psychic derailleur
Drive this car to the sea
Spend the night as high as I can in a towering hemlock

But it's no use. I can always be found
A creature of habit has no real protection
I tell her I'll leave if she don't settle down
She sees it’s a lie on closer inspection
Like everyone else does

Been rubbing a terrible charm
Holding smoke in my arms
I’m just a simple man, cursed with an honest heart
Watch her go and tear it all apart

Been rubbing a terrible charm
Holding smoke in my arms
I’m just a simple man, cursed with an honest heart
