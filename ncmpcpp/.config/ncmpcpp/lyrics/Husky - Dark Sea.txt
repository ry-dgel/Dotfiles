Tell me you will wake me in the night when all is lost
Brother, don't let it shake me up mornin' frost
If I could calm the storm that rages inside
I, I would surely try

Black night, cold heart
You're alive, you can't feel it
My god, lift him out
The dark sea he is swimmin' in

Black night, cold heart
You're alive, you can't feel it
My god, lift him out
The dark sea he is swimmin' in

We were once just children, staring up at the stars
When did we grow older and come so very far?
We could leave this town, this country, this life
We could live to learn and learn and live without a start
Trouble will strike

Black night, cold heart
You're alive, you can't feel it
My god, lift him out
The dark sea, he is swimmin' in

Black night, cold heart
You're alive, you can't feel it
My god, lift him out
The dark sea, he is swimmin' in
