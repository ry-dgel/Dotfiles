Your name is a triangle
Your heart is a square
I love to see you
Way over there
Once I was happy
I found it intriguing
Then you got to me
Left me bleeding
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
I thought we could eat bread
I thought we could talk
On darker days
With our boots kicked off
You looked to me
And I looked away
Though I had been looking
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
