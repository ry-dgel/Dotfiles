... you're just... always make that... heart
Die when I... when I said, don't make turn away
... I turn away,...
... you're just... always make that... heart
I've been... feel, and I'm thinking
You've been away, are you thinking...

In the mirror we are the...
In the movement...
Tonight's the night, I'm waiting
Tonight's the night, and I'm not feeling cold
So strong,... out to go,... never let you
Tonight's the night, I'm waiting
Tonight's the night, and I'm not feeling cold
So strong,... out to go,... never let you

... you're just... always make that... heart
Die when I... when I said, don't make turn away
... I turn away,...
... you're just... always make that... heart
I've been... feel, and I'm thinking
You've been away, are you thinking...
