[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I felt
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Wonder what if we trade
I tried but it's way too late
All the slides I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for
[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what is love
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop while it's not too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop before it's too late)
And I still don't know
[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
On this side of the rut
I'm thinking like what
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Moving it out this time
Going with what I always longed for
[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what is love
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
[Bridge]
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But baby this love is so different from the rest
And I know it seems hard to accept
But you've got to do it, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
I really know this shit is as good as it gets
And I know it seems hard to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So happy to know that it's right
In a new direction
So happy to know I've come to fall
Stop thinking that the only option was
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like
Stop thinking that the only option was
So happy to know I've come to fall
Stop thinking that the only option was
And I know it's hard to describe
Stop thinking that the only option was
So happy to know that it's right
