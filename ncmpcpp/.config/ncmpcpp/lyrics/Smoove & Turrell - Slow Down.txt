Slow down your moving too fast
With your head strung out on all your maybes
Low down your moment has passed
To hang around well it just seems too crazy
All you got is what you had
Salted lines to keep them fresh
Always there but nothings changed
Even your lies remain the same
It's what you do, it's what you have
That we have not seen lately
It's all a joke and such a laugh
How did it end up crazy
Shot down your record is scratched
No tune deserves to keep on playing
Broke down your dreams they have crashed
To the millions that you made this weekend
What you wear is all you own
No point talkin' bout your stately home
Always there but nothings changed
Even your lies remain the same
It's what you do, it's what you have
That we have not seen lately
It's all a joke and such a laugh
How did it end up crazy
The things you do, the thoughts you have
That we have not seen lately
It's all a joke live in the past
How did it end up crazy
To the times when you said what you would do

To the bluff aint enough to be your self now is it
To the lies that your friends have all seen through
To the times when the drugs took over you
To the bluff aint enough to be your self now is it
Slow down your moving too fast
With your head strung out on all your maybes
Low down your moment has passed
To hang around well it just seems too crazy
What you wear is all you own
No point talkin' bout your stately home
Always there but nothings changed
Even your lies remain the same
It's what you do, it's what you have
That we have not seen lately
It's all a joke and such a laugh
How did it end up crazy
The things you do, the thoughts you have
That we have not seen lately
It's all a joke live in the past
How did it end up crazy
To the times when you said what you would do
To the lies always drip all over you
To the bluff aint enough to be your self now is it
To the lies that your friends have all seen through
To the times when the drugs took over you
To the bluff aint enough to be your self now is it
