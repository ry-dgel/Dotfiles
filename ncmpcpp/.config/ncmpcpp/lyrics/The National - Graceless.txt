Graceless
Is there a powder to erase this?
Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

I'm trying, but I'm graceless
I don't have the sunny side to face this
I am invisible and weightless
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone
Through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody

Don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice
Just let me listen

Graceless
I figured out how to be faithless
But it would be a shame to waste this
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone
Through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody

Don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice
Just let me listen

All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means

I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones, they're my favorites
It's the side effects that save us
Grace

Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
Don't let 'em die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace

There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows without you

All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means

I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones they're my favorites
It's the side effects that save us
Grace

Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace

Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
