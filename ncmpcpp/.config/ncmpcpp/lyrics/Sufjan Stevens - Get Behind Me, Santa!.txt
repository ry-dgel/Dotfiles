I know whatcha doing to me boy,
You move so fast like a psychopathic color TV,
With your Christmas bag and your jolly face,
And the reindeer stompin' all over the place

Take it easy, what ya gotta be so absurd?
You make it sound like Christmas is a four-letter word 
Its a fact of life whether you like or not,
So put your hands together and give it a shot

I hope that you take it to heart boy,
It's Christmas time, ain't no clowning around 
And if you think you got something to prove boy, 
Santa Claus is coming to town

I don't care about family and shopping malls, 
Candy canes or the carolers decking the halls 
I don't care about what you say Santa Claus 
You're a bad brother breaking into people's garage 
Jeez!

You got it wrong,
'Cause I'm just another regular guy,
Super powers and a penchant for the Yuletime
Is it a crime to give a little once in awhile,
I travel 'round the world trying to make people smile

I know that you take it too hard boy,
It's Christmas time, ain't no clowning around
And if you think you got something to prove boy,
Santa Claus is coming to town 

C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S

Christmastime, Christmastime,
Christmastime,
Magic of Christmas,
Christmas, Christmastime,
Christmastime,
Have a good time!
