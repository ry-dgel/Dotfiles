The way things should be
Became all that I could see
But I could've never imagined that kiss
Love is this

And now what we know
Shows us what we've always known

I want to know you and hold you always
Won't you stay
The longer I was left alone
Helped me to find my sense of home
And missing your familiar ways
At night, i memorized your face
We've spent a long time waiting for
The chance to say
"We are here"
"We are here"

I found it unexpectedly
The luck that you should notice me
But wanting makes it hard to find
Differences between wrong and right
We've spent a long time waiting for
The chance to say
"We are here"
"We are here"
"We are here"
"We are here"
"We are here"
"We are here"
