Walk out before you make it worse on yourself
Now's not the time for that elegant laugh
Daggers from the people once by your side
Once by your side but now that is over
You'll have to pick up and just
Start again start again
 
You've fallen to earth and your collared in ice
But burning yourself ain't no challenge to winter
Gotta clip the lines and move for yourself
Just move for yourself luv
Now that it's over
You'll have to pick up and just
Watch your back, watch your back
 
And close your eyes to run far, far
Trap doors to the endless fields of our young land
Have we grown too tired in our land to fight
 
Look valentine if you want it to end
Your life at this temperature life under water
You've got to let these fools all trample themselves
They trample themselves just dying to enter
You're preaching to the choir
So turn around turn around

And close your eyes to run far, far
Trap doors to the endless fields of our young land
Have we grown too tired in our land to fight

And close your eyes to run far, far
Trap doors to the endless fields of our young land
Have we grown too tired in our land to fight
