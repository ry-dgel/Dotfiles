Massive laminate fortress
Hazy cannibus porches
Saying no to the bores
It's not mine or yours then I said
The wait sucks I don't mind waiting
Once you get here there's no more gates and I gotta say

Stealing happy hours [4x]

Don't wait one minute more to ask me
You make me feel like Hank Chinaski
In war all the time war (war) war all the time
We're snatching bits of time that
No one else can seem to find
