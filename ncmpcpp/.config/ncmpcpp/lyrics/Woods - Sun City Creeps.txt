the sun city creeps, did you see?
oh, let it go
we fall into love every day
and take as we go
you can turn into town
you can turn day to day
but please don't take it away
falling to pieces, falling apart
i'm falling today
the sun setting in (?)
let them waste
oh, let it go
ascend to the sky every day
and come to the now
you can turn into town
you can turn day to day
but please don't take it away
falling to pieces, falling apart
i'm falling today
