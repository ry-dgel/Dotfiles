In the end, it's stronger than I know how to be
And I can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering
I fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor
I don't want our footsteps to be silent anymore

Want them to be in the moment
Storm clouds are closing in

In the end, it's gone, and there's nothing left to do
But I'm still not certain just how I'm gonna feel

I only know in the moment
And anticipation is growing

It's getting closer, oh
It's getting closer
It's getting closer, oh
It's getting closer (it's right on time)

It's getting closer (closer every day)
It's getting closer (don't cry you'll be okay)
It's getting closer (closer call it a day)
It's getting closer (hold on, breathe if you can)
It's getting closer (I'm not dead yet)
It's getting closer (it's right on time)
It's getting closer (breathe if you can)
It's getting closer (I'm not dead yet)
It's getting closer (right on time)
It's getting closer, oh
It's getting closer
