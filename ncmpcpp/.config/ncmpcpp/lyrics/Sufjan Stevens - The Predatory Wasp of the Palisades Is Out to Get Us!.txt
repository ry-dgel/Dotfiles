Thinking outrageously, I write in cursive
I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor
Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers
I see my own breath on the face of the door

Oh, I am not quite sleeping
Oh, I am fast in bed
There on the wall in the bedroom creeping
I see a wasp with her wings outstretched

North of Savanna we swim in the Palisades
I come out wearing my brother's red hat
There on his shoulder, my best friend is bit seven times
He runs washing his face in his hands

Oh, how I meant to tease him
Oh, how I meant no harm
Touching his back with my hand, I kiss him
I see the wasp on the length of my arm

Oh great sights upon this state, hallelu
Wonders bright and rivers, lake, hallelu
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake, hallelu (We were in love, we were in love, Palisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can wait)
Trusting things beyond mistake, hallelu (We were in love, we were in love, Palisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can wait)

We were in love, we were in love
Palisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can wait

Lamb of God, we sound the horn, hallelujah (We were in love, we were in love, Palisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can wait)
To us, your ghost is born, hallelu (We were in love, we were in love, Palisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can wait)

I can't explain the state that I'm in
The state of my heart, he was my best friend
Into the car, from the backseat
Oh admiration in falling asleep

All of my powers, day after day
I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed
Deep in the tower, the prairies below
I can tell you, the telling gets old

Terrible sting and terrible storm
I can tell you the day we were born
My friend is gone, he ran away
I can tell you, I love him each day

Though we have sparred, wrestled, and raged
I can tell you I love him each day
Terrible sting, terrible storm
I can tell you
