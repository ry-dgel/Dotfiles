Angels we have heard on high
Singing for the earth's attention
And the mountains in reply
So much noise for my affection

Shepherds, why this jubilee
Have you seen a flying saucer?
And what the gladsome tidings be
Is it power and wealthier after?

Gloria, it speaks of your devotion
Gloria, the counting and commotion
Gloria, I cannot stand to listen
Gloria, it takes from my ambition
Gloria

Come to Bethlehem and see
The Son of God inside a manger
Come, adore on bended knee
Where dreams become your greatest danger

Gloria, it puts your heart in motion
Gloria, like some romantic notion
Gloria, it gives a great petition
Gloria, and takes from your ambition
Gloria

Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
