My God, I can't see how we are in love
What is this fate?
All the time that I believed that I would be lost
If I were alone
Hold it now, hold it now

So this is the last time (yeah) tonight?
One more time, baby, one more time
After time, after time, after time
So this is the last time (yeah) tonight?
One more time, baby, one more time
After time, after time, after time

How'd I forget your touch when I am alone?
Climbing the walls
Hard as I may try to stay apart for myself
There's something I want
Hold it now, hold it now

So this is the last time (yeah) tonight?
One more time, baby, one more time
After time, after time, after time
So this is the last time (yeah) tonight?
One more time, baby, one more time
After time, after time, after time
