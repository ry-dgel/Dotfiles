Because I lied with all my heart
It caused it's time to change my life

Of course you won't be missing that part of me
It's all you need when telling everyone that you're free
Hold on, you'll see, it won't be that hard to forget me
I hope you won't... I've been told endearing soul
Wish you knew I was too young

Because you cried does it mean you
Can talk to me when you decide

At least you won't be missing that part of me
It's all you need when telling everyone that you're free
Hold on, you'll see, it won't be that hard to forget me
I hope you won't... Will you forgive that I left?
Sure to pretend while you were hate

Erase you, ah, you, erase you, erase you
Erase you, erase you
