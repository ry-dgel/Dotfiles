Well, he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreaming about being loved by him.

Too bad your chances are slim

And it's not like mister shook to get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there

He's not too easily scared

He's got friends but they got fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh, look see there he is now coming down the stairs

Here he comes

He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact

Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one been remembered a thing when they saw him again

That's how it is 'til the end
Yeah
