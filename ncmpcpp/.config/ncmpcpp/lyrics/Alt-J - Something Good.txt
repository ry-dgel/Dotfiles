Something good, oh, something good
Oh, something good, something good
Tonight will make me forget about you for now
Get high, hit the floor before you go, matador
Estocada, you're my blood sport

Something good, oh, something good
Oh, something good, something good
Tonight will make me forget about you for now
Forty-eight thousand seats bleats
And roars for my memories of you

Now that I'm fully clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view
Get high, hit the floor before you go
Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport

Forty-eight thousand seats bleats
And roars for my memories of you
Now that I am clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view

But something good, oh, something good
Oh, something good, something good
Will make me forget about you for now
