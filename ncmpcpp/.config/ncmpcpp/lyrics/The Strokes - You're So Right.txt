If you like

Get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor
Every night

What are the reasons

To fall out

I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you
Nothing more

Girl, I am on at anytime
Girl, I once gave it up

I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office
Hello, forest

I still want to ask you
I still want to ask you
I still want to ask you
Something more

Girl, I am on at anytime
Girl, I once gave it up

I don't want to fight
Don't want to beg
You anymore

I don't want to fight
Don't want to beg
You anymore

I don't want to fight
Don't want to beg
You anymore

I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue
If you want

I wouldn't hurt you
I wouldn't hurt you
Well, maybe I'd hurt you
If I could
