Somewhere I lost my way inside
Ego waylaid relay
Fog of mine
Aspera into day
Light
Never meant for decay
We move in time
Feel high
Bathed in light
I thought I lost my way
We move in time
Somewhere I lost my way inside
Drifting from night into day
Road worn wide
Shifting our skin into clay
Light
Never meant for decay
We move in time
Feel high
Endless flight
We were never meant for decay
We move in time
Somewhere I lost my way inside
I thought I had lost my way inside
