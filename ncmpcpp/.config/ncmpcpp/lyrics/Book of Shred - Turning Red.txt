Chasing echoes through the corner of my mind
Hollow eyes are staring out into the night
Now the void is opened, calling me inside
It's hard to hide

I'm hanging by a thread, I'm waiting for your call
My hands are turning red
I'm hanging by a thread, I thought I had it all
My parachute's in shreds

All the miles I ride, body turning thin
A crumpled piece of paper trying to open
I'm climbing up the rabbit hole, I feel the spin
And taste the wind

I'm hanging by a thread, I'm waiting for your call
My hands are turning red
I'm hanging by a thread, I thought I had it all
My parachute's in shreds

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

I'm hanging by a thread, I'm waiting for your call
My hands are turning red
I'm hanging by a thread, I thought I had it all
My parachute's in shreds

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
