There is a singer everyone has heard
At night he turns into a mucking bird
If I whistle in the dark he'll do that to.

I met him on the road, 
At the close of day, 
Talk like me, walk this way 
I said mucking bird "You aint know where the way turn".

And there is a singer everyone knows, 
he makes round with late night show,
Shake the hands the massacred is on,
You turn him off the radio, 
when he say me and my shadow,
Shoot out the lights my shadows gone.

Down at the bottom of the kelena bay, 
find my raychad I can see your face,
if i m tired of two the dress, 
he has changed that keep him roll,
Down at the bottom of the kelena bay, 
1 for the money 2 for the show,
For me and my shadow.

Shoot out the lights and my shadow is gone,
Shoot out the lights and my shadow is gone.

There is a shadow everyone has heard,
At night he turns into a mucking bird,
If I whistle in the dark you will do that do,
I have met him on the road,
A silhouette on a black highway 
I said "You can have this world,
This world is not my own",
Then he said " You can keep this world,
This world is not my home".
