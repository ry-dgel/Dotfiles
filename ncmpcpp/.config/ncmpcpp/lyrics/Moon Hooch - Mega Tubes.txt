Can you see me?
an you see me?
an you feel me?
        
         
         can you see me?
  
         
come with me, take my hand 
I'll show you what I have planned 
there's a place far away 
you and I will find our way (x2)

come with me, take my hand 
I'll show you what I have planned 
there's a place far away 
you and I will find our way

can you feel me?
can you see me?

come with me, take my hand 
I'll show you what I have planned 
there's a place far away 
you and I will find our way (x2)

can you feel me?
can you see me?
