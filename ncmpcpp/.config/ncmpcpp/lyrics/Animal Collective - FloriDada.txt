Child of limousines
What's the best place
That you have seen
All of the hands
That you have shook
Home of the queen of
Everything fancy
Is there a smell
That you can tell
Gives you some peace
Sends you to hell
All of the beds
That you have yearned
Is there a dream to
Where you’d return
Where is the plight
With the most stars
Where do you drink
By Echo guitars
What’s the best shore
Seen from a boat
Miniature heads that
Color the shore line
If you could rest
A minute to tell
Get me some grass
Iridescent shells
I know there’s a nest
Fit with a hatch
Sunset a glowin’
Makes us all sweaty

I don’t even know where to begin
Or how I should start these days
The green mountain south or
The Clay of the westerns
The Maryland meadows at midnight
They do have a misty grace
Take a trip to blue bayou
Find Roy Orbison cryin’
A continent molded from glass
Or maybe a town I can taste
Dresses that glow on
Girls from Barcelona
I wanna discover the key
And open the everywhere place
A mix of sky from Montana
Dipped in FloriDada

Old demented men
Where is the place
We can extend
Crooked state lines
Polka dot signs
Say that this place is
A state of mind
Pretty lip girls
Paint me the halls
Not on a street
Not near a mall
Raise me a thumb
From human skin
That isn’t judged by
Where it begins
Show me the clams
Show me the pearls
Mail me a note
Sent from a world
That isn’t so far
And always right here
Where all the boundaries
Have disappeared
And all the nights
Are stitched with a glue
That’s sticking to me
And I’ll stick to you
I’ll take your hands
You’ll take my face
And everywhere home will
Be a good place

I found myself there a collagin’
With all of the human race
A dancer from Ghana
Smiling in Tijuana
I Frankenstein java with touches of Prada
And corn on the plates
A smear of gardenia
In the fair hair of Sweden
And maybe I actually visited
Some sort of mythical place
Or was it a future
Connected by sutures
Oh let’s go get lost in the image
I made of the everywhere place
I see the lads from Osaka
Dyed in FloriDada

Flori, Flori, Flori, Flori, Florida
FloriDada, FloriDada
Flori, Flori, Flori, Flori, Florida
FloriDada, FloriDada

Where’s the bridge that’s gonna take me home
The bridge that someone’s fighting over
A bridge that someone’s paying for
A bridge so old so let it go
Where’s the bridge that’s gonna take me home
The bridge that someone’s fighting over
A bridge that someone’s paying for
A bridge so old so let it go
Where’s the bridge that’s gonna take me home
The bridge that someone’s fighting over
A bridge that someone’s paying for
A bridge so old so let it go
Where’s the bridge that’s gonna take me home
The bridge that someone’s fighting over
A bridge that someone’s paying for
A bridge so old so let it go
