Sister say a prayer for us one we learned from nuns and such
I won't believe not a word you speak just make it sweet to hear
Let's pour wine in coffee cups and drive around the neighborhood
And shine the headlights on houses until all the news is good

Oh no! What would your mother say?
Oh no! What would your father do?
Oh no! What would the neighbors think?
Oh no! 

How am I supposed to sleep? Roaming blackouts on the streets
Oh not a word, not another speech, we'll run the headlights down
These kids are foaming at the mouth, psychotropic capricorns
Tomorrow's some kind of Strangerland where all the news is good

Oh no! What would your mother say?
Oh no! What would your father do?
Oh no! What would the neighbors think?
Oh no! If they only knew, knew

How can Monday be alright, then on Tuesday lose my mind?
Tomorrow's some kind of stranger who I'm not supposed to see

Oh no! What would your mother say?
Oh no! What would your father do?
Oh no! What would the neighbors think?
Oh no! If they only knew, knew
