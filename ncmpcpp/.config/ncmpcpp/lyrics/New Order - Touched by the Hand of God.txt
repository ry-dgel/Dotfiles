I was standing by the ocean when I saw your face
I couldn't look at you
I guess you knew it
But I never realized that we were through
And I'm now down here all alone with every feeling that I own
You can't take that away
And with every breath we take 
And the illusions we create will come to you someday

And I was touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was

I never hoped to do the things in this world I wanted to
Because everything I own, it belongs to you
I've never looked at you in a sexual way in my life before
And I've never woken up like this so desperately before 

And I was touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
Touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched (touched)
I was touched (touched)
