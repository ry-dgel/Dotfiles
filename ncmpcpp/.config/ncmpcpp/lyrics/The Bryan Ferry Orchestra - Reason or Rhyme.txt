Why must you shed such tender tears
In the evening of your years
No other love could stem the tide
Of the loneliness I hide

Open your heart and let me live
All the promises I could give
The sun and moon and all the stars
They bow down to you whenever you pass

In a world of fading sadness
An emerald ring, a photograph

That look in your eyes the brush of your cheek
These are the moments in life that I seek
No reason or rhyme, no presence of mind
Just a dance to the music of time

Why must you shed such tender tears
In the evening of your years
No other love could stem the tide
Of the loneliness I hide

Inside out, upside down
Obscured by clouds, or underground
The sun and moon and all the stars
They bow down to you whenever you pass

Wherever you are, whenever you speak
These are the moments in my life that I seek
No reason or rhyme, by chance or design
Just a dance to the music of time

Open your heart and let me live
All the promises I could give
The sun and moon and all the stars
They bow down to you whenever you pass

No reason or rhyme, no presence of mind
Just a dance to the music of time
