To think that I would die this time
Isolated in the room where the bed rises
Photographic ordinary people are everywhere
Extraordinary histories, ordinary histories, ordinary histories

I'll find sleep, I'll find peace
Or in death you'll sleep with me

To figure that it was my fault
Or so I've come to realize life is not about
Love with someone, ordinary people are everywhere
Extraordinary people are, ordinary people are, ordinary people are

Everywhere you look, everywhere you turn
Illness is watching, waiting its turn

Did I go at it wrong?
Did I go intentionally to destroy me?
I'm suffering in noise, I'm suffering in touching ordinary body
The burning from within the burning from with ordinary hysteria
I could not be at rest, I could not be at peace extraordinary hysteria

So do yourself some good, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes
Or do yourself a favor, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes

Illness likes to prey upon the lonely, prey upon the lonely
When it bites, oh, I would rather be dead, I would rather give up

I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well

And I forgive you even as you choke me that way
With the pill or demon and the shrouded shalom
Under conversation in tremendous weight of
A crowd of ages outside, dressed for murder

I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around

And shall I kiss you even as you take me that way?
With the pill or demon as my body changes
Apparitions gone awry, they surround me, all sides
But from within I see in unholy changes

I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
