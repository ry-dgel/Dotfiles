There's a knock at your door
You don't even recognize the stranger
It's you from before
Trying to warn you all about the dangers

There's a hole in your head
At least that's what everybody's guessing
It's why you're always misread
It's why you sleep but you never feel rested
You never get your rest in

Hold on to your heart
Hold it high above flood waters
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody drag it under
Hold on to your heart
Even when your body's bitter
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over from you

There's a call on the phone
You don't even recognize the number
It's an old episode
Of trying to put the lightning on the monster
Of the life you have led
That is always a mess
Are you dreaming of death
Are there ghosts in your chest
Are you always so restless
Yes you are, is that hard?

Hold on to your heart
Hold it high above flood waters
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody drag it under
Hold on to your heart
Even when your body's bitter
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over from you

Is it all a game of bait and switch your brains
And follow your leaders to hell
Is it all the same vein of insane
As drinking from a poisoned well

And I need new skin for this old skeleton of mine
Cause this one that I'm in
Has let me down once again
Over time

And I need new skin for this old skeleton of mine
Cause this one that I'm in
Has let me down once again
Over time

Hold on to your heart
Hold it high above flood waters
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody drag it under
Hold on to your heart
Even when the whole world's bitter
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over from you
