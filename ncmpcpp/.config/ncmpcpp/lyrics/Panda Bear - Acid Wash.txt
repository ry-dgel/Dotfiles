On a rope
Strung a crossing
The gulf
As a ship
On a sea
Cuts the froth
With a yell
As you've won against
The deep

Laugh, the chasm
Laugh, the chasm

From afar
For a frame changes course
As a flame
Gives a ruin a new name
With a yell
As you've won against
The dark

Graph the spasm
Graph the spasm
Graph the spasm
I'm past
