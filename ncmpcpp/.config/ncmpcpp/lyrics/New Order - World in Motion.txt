Express yourself, create the space
You know you can win, don't give up the chase
Beat the man, take him on
You never give up, it's one on one

(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) You can't be wrong
(Express yourself) When something's good, it's never gone

Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true

Now is the time, let everyone see
You never give up, that's how it should be
Don't get caught, make your own play
Express yourself, don't give it away

(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) You can't be wrong
(Express yourself) When something's good, it's never gone

Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true

Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true

You've got to hold and give, but do it at the right time
You can be slow or fast, but you must get to the line
They'll always hit you and hurt you, defend and attack
There's only one way to beat them, get 'round the back

Catch me if you can, 'cause I'm the England man
And what you're looking at is the master plan
We ain't no hooligans, this ain't a football song
Three lions on my chest, I know we can't go wrong

We're playing for England (In-ger-land)
We're playing the song
We're singing for England (In-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one

We're playing for England (In-ger-land)
We're playing the song
We're singing for England (In-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one

We're playing for England (In-ger-land)
We're playing the song
We're singing for England (In-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one

We're playing for England (In-ger-land)
We're playing the song
We're singing for England (In-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
