After all is said and done, I feel the same
All that I hoped would change within me stayed
Like a huddled moon, lit exile on the shore
Warming his hands, a thousand years ago
 
I walk with others in me yearning to get out
Claw at my skin and gnash their teeth and shout
One of them wants only to be someone you'd admire
One would as soon just throw you on the fire
 
After all is said and after all is done
God only knows which of them I'll become
