They're gonna send us to prison for jerks
or having vague ideas of the way to turn each other on again
hey're gonna send us to prison for jerks
         
           
They'll find us here here here in the guest room
where we throw money at each other and cry, oh my

We miss being ruffians, going wild and bright
in the corners of front yards
getting in and out of cars
we miss being deviants

They'll find us here here here in the guest room
where we throw money at each other and cry, oh my

We can't stay here
we're starting to stay the same
we can't stay here
we can't stay this way

Just tie your woman to your wrist
give her room to tie the other

They'll find us here here here in the guest room
where we throw money at each other and cry, oh my
