The dust from a four day affair is now landing
All over the floor and your brown legs
The gold-plated legs of my rival
Whose eyes had no reason to fall

You led no celibate life
No skirt while chemicals danced in your head
You stole the keys to this ride
And your fables are falling tonight

Because of your struggle to make them
Their taste for your pastime is fading
Remember the girls in the middle
Are always the first to fall off

You've learned to live like a mouse
Searching the cracks in the walls to remember
All of the dregs in the crowd
You barely recall

You led no celibate life
No skirt while chemicals danced in your head
You stole the keys to this ride
And your fables are falling tonight
