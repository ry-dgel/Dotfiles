My love, your house has many rooms
The kitchen's filled with food
I'll find a place inside

The dreams that pass across your face
Come from a secret place
Ev'ryone close your eyes

It's true, I am a shaky ladder
Intergalactic matter
Outside of space and time

But who is standing on your street?
These buildings are not real
My tricks are useless here

It's true, that's what a lover hears
It's what a fool believes
It's not too late to try

Someday I'll step out from the shadow
Intergalactic matter
Outside of space and time

Dirty feet, crooked teeth
Somewhere out beyond the stars
A funny face, so lost in space are we

Ev'ryone's enlightened ev'ryday
You may reach Nirvana when you comb your hair

I know, we'll join this cosmic saga
Intergalactic matter
Where we will meet tonight
Spiraling out of sight
Outside of space and time
