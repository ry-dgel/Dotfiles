Boy you know you make me float
Boy you really get me high
I feel like I’m on dope
Cause you, you serve me on a regular
Boy we need to tie this rope
Before we drift any deeper
There now hold me close
Boy let’s take this overboard now

[Chorus:]
I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle
Work the middle
Change positions, new positions
New positions, new positions
Stroke on me, stroke it on me
Stroke it on me, stroke it on me

Ooh baby I love your stroke
Cause you, cause you get me to where I’m going
In a jury you’ll get my vote
Cause I believe
I believe you know just what you doing now
Baby now we can coast
Just don’t get in a hurry
That’s too slow
Go ahead and put that thing in overdrive

[Chorus]

Stroke it for me
Stroke it baby, stroke it baby
Mmmm, work it baby, work it baby
Oooh stroke It
There is somethin' I want you to do
I need you to use yourself
Like you never ever used to do before
To explore my body
Until you reach the shore
You’ll be calling, calling for more

[Chorus x2]
