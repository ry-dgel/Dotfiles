How did anybody find out where I was?
How did anybody find that out?
I was hiding from the world, I was a squirrel
But you chopped down my tree to get my fur

Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Oh, fear of sleep
Can't you wait?
I'm not done
Fear of sleep
Here you come

Fear of sleep
You're no fun

I guess everybody's week must have been pretty rough
'Cause everybody's drunk, loud, and pissed off
I know you hate to be impressed by someone else, other than yourself
But you know, trying to hold back on being an asshole helps

Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Where'd you go?
Fear of sleep
Oh, fear of sleep
So you know
I'm not done
Here we go
Here you come

Fear of sleep
You're no fun
