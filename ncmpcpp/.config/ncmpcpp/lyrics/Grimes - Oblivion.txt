And now the walk about, after dark, it's my point of view
If someone could break your neck, coming up behind you
Always coming and you'd never have a clue
And now the look behind, all the time, I will wait forever
Always looking straight
Thinking, counting all the hours you wait

See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night

And now another clue, I would ask if you could help me out
It's hard to understand 'cause when you're running by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand
And now it's good to be tough on me but I will wait forever
I need someone else to look into my eyes and tell me
Girl you know you gotta watch your health

To look into my eyes and tell me, la la la la la
To look into my eyes and tell me, la la la la la

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la 
La la la la la

See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
