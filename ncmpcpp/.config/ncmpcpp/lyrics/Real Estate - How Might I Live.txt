How might I live to betray you?
How might I live to see the day?
How might I live to say you're not the one I love?
How might I find the words to say?

Down in my home, Louisiana
Down in my home where I stayed
Got to find the words to say you're not the one I love
How might I live to see the day?

But I can't, so I'm rolling on
Call it fuel for other songs
But I can't, so I'm rolling on
How might I live to see the day?
