Michael, Michael, Michael, wake up we're going back to chelmsley wood
Michael, Michael, Michael, my feet are dancing can you see them
Michael, Michael, Michael, I'll change my hair but inside I'll stay the same
Michael, Michael, Michael, I'll draw my lips around my lipstick

My feet are dancing so much and I hate that, my feet are dancing so much
Ah, see if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that change
Then let go, let go, let go, let go

Michael, Michael, Michael, come on your father was a teddy boy
Michael, Michael, Michael, there's nothing written on your fingernails
Michael, Michael, Michael, you said remind me not to be myself 
Michael, Michael, Michael, this is not your saw tooth wave

Ah, see if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that change
Then let go, let go, let go, let go
My feet are dancing so much and I hate that, my feet are dancing so much
My feet are dancing so much and I hate that, my feet are dancing so much
Ah, see if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that change
Then let go, let go, let go, let go

Michael, Michael, Michael, today the old height rise is coming down
Michael, Michael, Michael, this is not your saw tooth wave
