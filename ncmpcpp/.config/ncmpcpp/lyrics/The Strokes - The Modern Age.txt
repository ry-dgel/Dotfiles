Up on a hill is where we begin
This little story, a long time ago
Stop to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending

Oh, in the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go
Oh, let me
G-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time
Staying there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So I'll pretend I'm leaving

Our fears are different here
We train in A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed
My vision's clearer now but I'm unafraid
Flying overseas
No time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties

Oh, in the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go (woo)
Darling, let me
G-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So this is why I'm leaving
