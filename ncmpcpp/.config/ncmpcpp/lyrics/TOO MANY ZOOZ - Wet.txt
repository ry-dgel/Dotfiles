He took one step over the line
He didn't know what he would find
It's just a matter of time
He's gonna blow his mind
He tells you this he's telling you that
He's been lying behind your back
You gotta face the facts
He don't know his mind

Too many people
Walking the line
Trying to run as fast as they can
Too many people
Crossing the line
Untill they run out of time...
Out of time...

He thought he was one of a kind
But growing up can be a dangerous time
He's got a mind of his own and his world is one big show
He's caught up in the headlines
He says that he's alright
He says he's got his feet on the ground
It's just a matter of time
Before he blows his mind

Too many people
Walking the line
Trying to run as fast as they can
Too many people
Crossing the line
Until they run out of time...
Out of time...

There's people lost in this poor world with hunger in their eyes
There's people lost in this sad world sleeping under the sky...
It's just a matter of time...

Too many people
Walking the line
Trying to run as fast as they can
Too many people
Crossing the line
Until they run out of time
Too many people
