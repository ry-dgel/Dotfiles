When our souls were introduced
o one of us could ever know
hat we will be going through
         
           Feeling high, feeling low 

Been in hell, been above
Cried for help, cried for love
And when darkness sleeps beside you
And the morning is far away
I wanna hold your hand and guide you

Out of hell, out of darkness
Finally weÂ´re able to see
See the beauty not the beasts
One step further up at least
But one day

We will shine, we will shine
We will fly so high
We will shine, we will shine
We will fly so high
High
