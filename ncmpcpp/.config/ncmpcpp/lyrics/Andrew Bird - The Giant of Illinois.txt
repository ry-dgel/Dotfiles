The giant of Illinois
Died of a blister on its toe
After walking all day through the first winter's snow

Throwing bits of stale bread
To the last speck of dawn
He never even felt his shoe fill with blood

Delirious with pain
His bedroom walls began to glow
And he felt himself floating up to falling snow
And the sky was a woman's arms
And the sky was a woman's arms

A boy and dog with a clubbed foot 
Sat next to him on his tomb
Once upon a summer's day they were walking through the woods

They spotted a sleeping swan
On the beds of a muddy stream
They stoned it with rocks till it collapsed in the reeds

They laid out on the grass
Full with chocolate and lemonade
And underneath it all the giant was afraid
And the sky was a woman's arms - Oh, the sky was a woman's arms
And the sky was a woman's arms
