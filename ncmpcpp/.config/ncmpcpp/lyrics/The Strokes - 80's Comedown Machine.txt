[Verse]
It's not the first time
That I've watched you
Passing by
I've tried too hard
To get back there
But, you never try
Anymore

Tried to get in with you
For a second time
You said the world closed down
But, you caught it

Get back inside

[Chorus]

So please
Run away
So please
Run away

[Verse]

I tried to believe in it
For a second try
It's there in the safe
Why don't you
Close the blinds

For the night?

[Chorus]

So please
Run away
So please
Run away

[Instrumental]

So please
Run away
So please
Run away
Run away
So please
Run away
Runaway
