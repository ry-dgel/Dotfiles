Ain't shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal eenie meeny miny mo
And flower you're the chosen one

Well your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun, oh no

I tackle, we tussle
And oh my days we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt single-action army

Well your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun, oh no

N-E-O, O-M-G, gee whiz
Girl you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
All my days he disagrees, oh no
(Speak easy)

Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free

Ain't shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal eenie meeny miny mo
And flower you're the chosen one

Well your left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Oh no
