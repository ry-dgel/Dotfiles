I used to think it glad while at my country seat
Now I'm peaking in so many ways
the gloom is in retreat
Yeah the dark epoch is over I've found my efeblum
Then passed Ernst's mausoleum defended by a rook
Who shot a look so virulent it pierced me like a hook
The palaver of Solipsists exploding in my skull

Yeah and we both despise all of the academic swine
Who made the author of "Discus Ulysses" benign?

So what if Wednesday finds us
Wearing rabies parachutes
Foaming like the melody of sea foam fairy flutes
The atmosphere is viscous we're sticking to the brine

Yeah and we both despise all of the academic swine
Who made the author of "Discus Ulysses" benign?

When the lanterns fill with finches
So begins the brawl
Their brains are like porcupines
And mine's a paper ball
When the lanterns fill with finches
So begins the brawl
Their brains are like porcupines
And mine's a paper ball
I know they don't understand they don't get us at all
Their moss mangles polyanthus
And mine's a paper ball
