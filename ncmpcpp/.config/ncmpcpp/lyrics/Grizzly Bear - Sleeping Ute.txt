Dreamed the long day just wandering free
Though I'm far gone you sleep nearer to me
If I could find peace
If this night leaves
But I can't help myself

So I'll walk out these wandering dreams
Up the north road dressed gold and green
If I could lie still as that great hill
But I can't help myself

Well it's calm and clear
Collapsed here on the stone
Delivered to this place
A vision dark and cloaked
And those figures through the leaves
And that light through the smoke
And those countless empty days made me dizzy when I woke
And I live to see your face
And I hate to see you go
But I know no other way than straight on out the door
And I can't help myself
