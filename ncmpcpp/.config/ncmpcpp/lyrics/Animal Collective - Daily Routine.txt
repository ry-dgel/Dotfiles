Just a sec more in my bed
Hope the machine's working right
When it's just precisely tuned
Is how it comes out so nice
Make sure my kid's got a jacket
Keys and coat and shoes and hat
Strap a stroller to my back
Bouncing along every crack

What can I do to make it fast?
Sing a song to pass the playground
What can I do as traffic pass?
Guard my girl from muffler's black gas
What can I do to make it fast?
Pop a jump but not too hard
Take a little left up at the rest
Stop and look at the traffic signal
Up uneven steps and talking's hard

Just a sec more in my bed
Hope the machine's working right
When it's just precisely tuned
Is how it comes out so nice
Make sure my kid's got a jacket
Keys and coat and shoes and hat
Strap a stroller to my back
Bouncing along every crack

What can I do to make it fast?
Sing a song to pass the playground
What can I do as traffic pass?
Guard my girl from muffler's black gas
What can I do to make it fast?
Pop a jump but not too hard
Take a little left up at the rest
Stop and look at the traffic signal

Just a sec more in my bed
Just a sec more in my bed
Just a sec more in my bed
Hope my machine's working right
Just a sec more in my bed
Hope my machine's working right
