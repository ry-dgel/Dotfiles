Just over the horizon
That's where I'll always think you'll be
And it's always so surprising
To find you right there next to me

In this sprawling landscape 
How'd you know just where I'd be?

Just over the horizon
That's when I always think you'll be
And it's always so surprising 
To find you right there next to me 

In this sprawling landscape
How'd you know just where I'd be?
I find it hard to believe
Just one season is all I'd need

How'd you know just where I'd be?

Just one season is all I'd need
