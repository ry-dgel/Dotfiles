Here we go again back to the start
I am now the one that breaks your heart
Always trying to hold but now I'm tired 

Here I go, the endless shore
Couldn't say if I was wrong

Here we go again back to my silence
I am such a fool to think you'll follow

Here I go, the endless shore
Couldn't say if I was wrong

Dear, it's my favourite sour
Is it any silent soul, he was the honest one
I couldnâ€™t give him hope, he was the silent soul
He was the honest one, give me anyone, then

Here I go again, their sun are on the cycle
Over the town there you are only partner
