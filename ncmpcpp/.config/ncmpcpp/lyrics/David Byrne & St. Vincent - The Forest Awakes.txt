The forest awakes
A desert at dawn
A mountain at night
And the river moves on

The people awake
They're marching along
The streets are alive
With a terrible song

Forwards and backwards in ev'ry direction
The atom's perpetual motion
The shifting of light on the banks of the river
I'm free, but I'm keeping my clothes on

We're marching along
The street where you live
I'm calling your name
The song is a gift

A song is a road
A road is a face
A face is a time
And a time is a place

A place of belief and a time of confusion
The heart is a simple equation
With beautiful words and with beautiful people
A song is a face is a mountain

A fruit that falls before it's grown
I heard a sound and bird has flown
It breaks pieces above the forest
A million particles born today

Out beyond the blue horizon, air cannot escape
Underneath the weeping willow, I can see your face

Free form, climbing all over me
Creatures great and small
Doctors, pulling them out of you
Hideous, virtuous, both of us

Come in my kitchen when it rains outside
Sweet inspiration sneaks up from behind

The forest is true
I know for a fact
That the bigger the front
The bigger the back

My heart beating still
Through the perilous night
The bombs burst in air
But my hair is all right

The shifting of light on the trees and the houses
I drown in an ocean of perfume
The strangeness of words, how the meaning keeps changing
But somehow the beauty will find you
