Will you find my?
Will you find my taste?
Will you find my?
Will you find my taste?

Am I really all the things that are outside of me?
Would I complete myself without the things I like around?
Does the music that I make play on my awkward face?
Do you appreciate the subtleties of taste, bud?

My friend and me were having a laugh (I don't get them)
In a living room filled with arts and crafts (Not their hearts, their taste)
He said, "I like their clothes and their china plates (There's no need to protect)
But what I really want is a simple place (My comforts)
With no flashy clothes 'cause you can eat those" (Serious threats, threats, threats)

Only ma'd pretend to like the clothes she showed to me (I know that body's built like rock)
Something in my heart can tell me it's a weakness (But I'll take you on)
And maybe you would have more luck playing those tasty games (How would you talk to all your kids?)
But me, I called and called and never heard from her again (Keep them on your knee)

It'd sure feel good to share our favorite things (I don't get them)
I'll keep an open mind if you let me in (Not their hearts, their taste)
Don't let your temper rise, don't get a bitter face (There's no need to protect)
Try not to judge me on my kind of taste (My comforts)
And don't go changing clothes when they don't like yours (Serious threats, threats, threats)

Am I really all the things that are outside of me?
Am I really all the things that are outside of me?
Am I really all the things that are outside of me?

Am I really all the things that are outside of me?
Am I really all the things that are outside of me?

Am I really all the things that are outside of me?
