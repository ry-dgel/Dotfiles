Oh, no, the rugged soul
The great backyard and the cold North Pole
I resent that Santa went and
Left us in the Alamo
Would you like to stay a while and dance with me?
Would you like to wrap the gifts and have a drink?

The only condition (I know the one)
I've got the premonition (I've got a clue)
That Christmas is a vision (For Christmas)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
If drinking makes it easy (So pass one here)
The music's kinda cheesy (And sing a cheer)
The specials on the TV (Especially)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho

Dreams go and stay below
The cattle call and the old dark soul
I respect that Santa left
To save his kids from the winter cold
Would you like to stay a while and dance with me?
Mistletoe and chestnuts roasting on the street

The only condition (I know the one)
I've got the premonition (I've got a clue)
That Christmas is a vision (For Christmas)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
If drinking makes it easy (So pass one here)
The music's kinda cheesy (And sing a cheer)
The specials on the TV (Especially)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho

No one can save you from Christmases past
You'll have to love it or leave it at last
No one can save you from Christmases past
You'll have to love it or leave it at last
No one can save you from Christmases past
You'll have to love it or leave it at last
