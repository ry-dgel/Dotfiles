Now if you think I'm wasting your time again
I'm wasting your time
When you pick me up in duty free
That's when I thought I'd be the cross in your T
Or must see TV
  
Tram pam pam pam, but
If you think I'm wasting your time again
No, oh, you're wasting mine
When you're playing for a prime-time dream
The CNB scene
Now I'm just a split in your seam the I in your team
  
Oooh please don't get too excited
Oooh maybe you're not invited
To my action adventure
My action adventure dream
  
So when you think you're on the fast track
You find it's just a cul-de-sac back
In that adult lifestyle community
Where all your little boys, your action toys are duty free
  
Oooh please don't get too excited
Ooooh maybe you're not invited
To my action adventure
My action adventure dream

So I wonder what you got your persona for
Cause there's a 2-for-one down at the corner-store
And I wonder could ya pep it up a bit
You know throw a fit
You go ahead and dance
I'll just sit
  
If you think I'm wasting your time again
I'm wasting your time again
oh, you're wasting mine
When you're playing for a prime-time dream
The CNB scene
Now I'm just a split in your seam the I in your team

So I'm looking at the back of my hand again
Oh, I'm looking at the back of my hand again,
To what end if I can't even find a goddamn pen
