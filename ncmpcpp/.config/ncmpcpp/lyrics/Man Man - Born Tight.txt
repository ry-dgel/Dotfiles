Catch a tiger by the toe
And when it bites you, don't let go
You bite it back so it knows
That you're wild and you're born on a tightrope

Build a fortress up on a hill
Find a love that fits the bill
Sometimes it never will
So you burn it down and you notch the kill

Mama Mama, Mama Mama Mama 
Can't help you now!
(Be brave)

Mama Mama, Mama Mama Mama 
Can't help you now!
(Be brave)

Mama Mama, Mama Mama Mama 
Can't help you now!
(Be brave)

Mama Mama, Mama Mama Mama 
Can't help you now!

You wear your fears up on your shoulders
Like a bird with the weight of a boulder
Will you pretend the pretense is over?
Will you let your anger smolder?

When my mind gets old and decrepit
And my heart forgets how to forgive
Hide a bullet in my nose
And whisper that I was born on a tightrope

Mama Mama, Mama Mama Mama 
Can't help you now!
(Be brave)

Mama Mama, Mama Mama Mama 
Can't help you now!
(Be brave)

Mama Mama, Mama Mama Mama 
Can't help you now!

And the only thing that I ever learned to be true was that:

(Be brave)
(Be brave)
Girls just wanna have fun!
(Be brave)
Girls just wanna have fun!
(Be brave)
Girls just wanna have fun!
(Be brave)
Girls just wanna have fun!
(Be brave)
(Be brave)
(Be brave)

Aah!
