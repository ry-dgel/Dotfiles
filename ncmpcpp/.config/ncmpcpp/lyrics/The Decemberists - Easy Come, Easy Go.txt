Limber Jack, he landed on his back
Was betting on the netting when the rigging went slack
Was a moonless night, the stars all lending light
She's leering in the mirror when the road it broke right

'Cause you never really know
When the whistle's gonna blow
You never really know
Easy come and easy go

He was a stand-up gent, but no one knew his bent
And all the little bones that he hid in his vent
She was the come-on queen, jewel on the scene
They found her in the shower, she'd been gone for seven weeks

'Cause you never really know
When the whistle's gonna blow
You never really know
Easy come and easy go

'Cause you never really know
When the whistle's gonna blow
You never really know
Easy come and easy go

Oh, limber Jack, his name is on the plaque
His mother is another that will never get him back
