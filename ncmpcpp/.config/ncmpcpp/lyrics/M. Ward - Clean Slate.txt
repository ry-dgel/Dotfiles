When i was a younger man
 thought the pain of defeat will last forever
ow I don’t know what it will take to make my heart back down
         
           Cause i only have to wait a little while before I get mine
Clean slate
Then somewhere in another place
Could be another life time
Everything we gave away returns like a seed form of a fugitive train

Only have to wait a little while before you find the truth
Truth
Now I don’t know what it will take to make my heart back down
Cause i only have to wait a little while before I get mine
Clean slate
