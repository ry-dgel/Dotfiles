Most of what I like
Is given to me by
The one that I love
Bears the onus every time

Technically I don't deserve to live this kind of life
Perturbed at what I might become
Unchanging every time

Ecstasy is what I'm needing
I'm bleeding from the eyes
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should never be displayed

Face to face is nice
But sharper than a knife
I teeter on it's edge
Just waiting to be sliced
Returning home brain dead
And you inject the life
Appeal to me love
Remake, rebuild, revise
Restavit is what I'm bleeding
A laxative to cry
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should never be displayed
