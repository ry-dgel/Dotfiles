Back in the head where I see red
Where the beast and the beauty coalesce
I give in to a morbid fantasy
Death to a billion families and me

Give me fire, burning hell
Throw it on my paper trail
And I’ll watch as all the numbers go
Up in a cloud of dark and dirty smoke

Ya I’m just waiting for the end of the world
End of the whole wide world
End of the whole world
Waiting for the world to end

Everybody come with me
Let’s throw ourselves off Hubbard’s peak
And we’ll tumble down the mountainside
Into the mouth of all our great divides

Ya I’m just waiting for the end of the world
End of the whole wide world
End of the whole world
Waiting for the world to end

Don’t you find…can take such a long time my friend
Don’t you find…can take such a long time my friend
Don’t you find that it can take such a long time my friend
I said don’t you find that it can take just such a long time my friend

Waiting for the world to end?
I’m still waiting for the world to end
