Open up your, open up your, open up your throat
And let time, all of that time, all of that time, all of that time go
I know it sucks that daddy's done but try to think of what you want
You've got to open up your, open up your, open up your throat, Matt

Open up your, open up your, open up your, open up your
Open up your, open up your, open up your, open up your
Open up your, open up your, open up your, open up your
Open up your, open up your, open up your throat

Open up your, open up your, open up your throat
And let time, all of that time, all of that time, all of that time go
I know it sucks that daddy's done but try to think of what you want
You've got to open up your, open up your, open up your throat, Matt
