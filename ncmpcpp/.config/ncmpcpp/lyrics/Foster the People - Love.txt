Hello, my name is Mark
I play gentlemen's games
And I just slip through and creep in
Through the night's parade
I shake a hand or two
I flip my hat to you
I'm always runnin' and a-jumpin'
Like a fool who would do

On through the wild I see her
She sees me, we could be
Something, it's exciting
Wanna run away
But I don't move, I stay
I talk to her, I say
Y-y-y-you were meant for me
Oh, I can't speak
I think I'm falling in love

Love, love, love
It could be a wonderful thing
Love, love
It could make you crazy

Sarah, she's a cougar 
Got moves like barracudas
On the hunt for the runts 
That look under twenty-two years
Got her head up high
High heels that match her thighs
And she be spending lots of money
Her friends think she's real funny

She says, "Hey, look at me
You will see that I'm a queen
Got experience to give 
Of a life you never lived"
But all the boys just run
She never has her fun
Oh yeah, but Sarah, she don't care
She keeps looking, 'cause she's hoping for love

Love, love, love
It could be a wonderful thing
Love, love
It could make you crazy
Love, love, love
It could be an incredible thing
Love, love
If you have it, it's amazing

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah

I got the fever, got the fever, got the fever, I said
She's got the fever, got the fever 
Yeah, I'm falling in love
He's got the fever, got the fever, got the fever, I see it
They've got the fever, got the fever
Yeah, I'm falling in love

Love, love, love
It could be a wonderful thing
Love, love
It could make you crazy
Love, love, love
It could be an incredible thing
Love, love
If you have it, it's amazing
