It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious sign of old
Enraptured secret sign of fear 
In brave disguises

Old shoes and thirty feet
The prophet's sign of prophecy
I resign to petty things
Like angels bending on their knees

Do you delight, do you delight, in me
I laughed about it
Come to me now, come to now, and bring
That rapture's moment
I wasn't changed, I wasn't changed, one bit
Though you may doubt it
I don't suppose, I don't suppose, you'd care
To ask about it

The dead of winter takes a grip
And moves around us
All night our labors clap and kiss
Like working mothers

Old wounds and thirty feet
The clock it sounds of properties
I resign to glorious things
Like angels bending on their knees

Do you delight, do you delight, in me
I laughed about it
Come to me now, come to now, and bring
That rapture's moment
I wasn't changed, I wasn't changed, one bit
Though you may doubt it
I don't suppose, I don't suppose, you'd care
To ask about it

I will delight, I will delight, in this
Though you may doubt it
Come to me now, come to me now, my kiss
And ask about it

I will delight, I will delight, in this
Though you may doubt it
Come to me now, come to me now, my kiss
