Attention senses, sorrow's song
Forboding phrases, notes lie long

Frame this sky unchanging window
Blown open by unchanging wind
Claim it quick 'cause sorrow wants it
Snatch the breath before it sings

Feathers woven, pattern tied
With every measure, sorrow flies

Frame this sky unchanging window
Blown open by unchanging wind
Claim it quick 'cause sorrow wants it
Snatch the breath before it sings

Attention senses, sorrow's song
Forboding phrases, notes lie long

Frame this sky unchanging window
Blown open by unchanging wind
Claim it quick 'cause sorrow wants it
Snatch the breath before it sings
