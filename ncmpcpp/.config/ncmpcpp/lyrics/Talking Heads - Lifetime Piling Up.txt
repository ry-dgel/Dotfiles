I have tried marijuana, I get nervous every time
There will come a knockin' at the door
Why is everybody makin' eyes at me?
I don't want to know
Excuse and pardon me, stay for a while
Maybe we'll never meet again

And I can see my lifetime pilin' up
I can see the days turn into nights
I can see the people on the street
Open those windows up
A hundred floors below me
Pilin' those houses up
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher
I can feel them swayin' back and forth
Building it higher, higher
This tower's leaning over

I got bad coordination, stuck a pencil in my eye
I can hardly wait to get back home
Why is everybody gettin' paranoid?
I's only havin' fun
Scumbags and superstars, tell me your names
I'll make a bet you're both the same

I can see my lifetime pilin' up
Reaching from my bedroom to the stars
I can see the house where I was born
When I was growin' up
They say that I could never keep my trousers up
I remember days and crazy nights
Are there any pirates on this ship?
And if they sober up
They'll have us home by morning

Cry, cry, cry
It's just you and I
Like an automobile
With no one at the wheel
We're spinning out of control
We're all over the road
In our sexy machine
Oh, the passengers scream, scream, scream

I can see my lifetime pilin' up
I can see it smashin' into yours
It was not an accident at all
Open your window up
I hear you laughin'
Going one, two, three, four, five
Goin' from the bottom to the top
Maybe I'm holding on too tight
And now I'm throwin' up
I got a funny feeling
Pilin' those houses up
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher
Building that highway to the stars
Turning the music up
Hey, I got a winning number
