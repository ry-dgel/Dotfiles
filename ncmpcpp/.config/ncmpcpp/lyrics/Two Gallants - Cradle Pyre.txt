On a tidal wave I stand,
erhaps of me you've heard?
ith a storm cloud in my hand,
         
           Well I've come dispensing words.

Of your company I've tired,
Your welcome here is worn,
It's you who lit this cradle pyre,
It is you who woke the storm.
It is you who woke the storm.

And so I do this with regret,
But you left me little choice,
When your mouth is full of threats,
When you speak you use my voice,
When you speak you use my voice.

Oh child where will you run,
When the world's on fire?
Oh man see what you've done,
As the flames grow higher.
