Railroad Bill
Railroad Bill
He never worked and he never will
I'm going to ride Railroad Bill

Well Railroad Bill was a mighty mean man
Shot the light out the brakeman's hand
I'm going to ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well Miss MacMillan
She whooped and she squalled
That's my husband for I heard him fall
I'm going to ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well I went down on number one
Railroad Bill had just begun
I'm going to ride Railroad Bill

Well I came back on number two
Railroad Bill had just got through
I'm going to ride Railroad Bill

Well I went down on number four
Someone let fly with a 44
I'm going to ride Railroad Bill

Got a 38 special on a 45 frame
I ain't going to miss cause I've got dead aim
I'm going to ride bad Railroad Bill

Well Railroad Bill rolling down a hill
Lighting cigars with a ten dollar bill
I'm going to ride bad Railroad Bill

Well Railroad Bill
Says before I die
Want to build a railroad for the bums to ride
I'm going to ride that bad Railroad Bill
