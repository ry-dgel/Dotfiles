So you're wishing that you never did all the embarrassing things you've done
And you're wishing you could set it right
And you're wishing you could stay the night
But then I go again, wishing never solved the problem
If you wanna get it big time, go ahead and get it, get it big time

So I think I can solve all problems by myself
Oh nevermind, nevermind, nevermind, nevermind, nevermind 

And you think you can solve all your problems by yourself
Oh nevermind, nevermind, nevermind, nevermind, nevermind

Uh give it, give it, give it, give it
Until you just can't give no more
Uh give it, give it, give it, give it
Until you just can't give no more

Uh give it, give it, give it, give it
Until you just can't give no more
Uh give it, give it, give it, give it
Until you just can't give no more
