The sky is faint, there tears remain in me
The rain has stopped falling
The fading light falls barely white in me 
The night has stopped calling 

I will not lament with the sky
No longer feel night on the inside

Here in this room, no more a tomb
Thoughts of you conclude without ending
Caution will keep, worries still speak
Fewer the leaves are descending

I will not lament with the sky
No longer feel night on the inside

Here in this room, no more a tomb
Thoughts of you conclude without ending

The lonely distance and time
The only tears willing outside
I will not lament with the sky
No longer feel night on the inside
