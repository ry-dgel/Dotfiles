It was Labor Day weekend, I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and a some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset
And that's a day I'll never forget
I had a BBQ stain on my white T-shirt
She was killing me in that mini-skirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that
Well, it was five years later on a south bound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past comin' from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said, "I bet you don't remember me"
And I said, "Only every other memory"
I had a BBQ stain on my white T-shirt
You were killing me in that mini-skirt
Skipping rocks on the river railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget somethin' like that
Like an old photograph, time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love never fades away
I had a BBQ stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that mini-skirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget
I said a heart don't forget, somethin' like that
Oh no, not somethin' like that
