Well, he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you dreamin' about loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim

And it's not like Mr. Shuck
To get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there
But he's not too easily scared

He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs

(Here he comes)

He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac, yeah
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact

Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
Nobody remembered a thing when they saw him again
That's how it is till the end (yeah)
