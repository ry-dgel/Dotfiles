Alexander all alone
Smoking a cigarette
The last pack he'd ever buy
At least that's what he said
He stood up to stretch his back
And fell down to the ground

Alexander all alone
Til the neighbor caught a glimpse
Cried out for his wife to call the ambulance
Alexander all alone
Felt them check his pulse
He heard them pronounce him dead

Hell is found inside of me
And nothing else will set me free
If hell is found inside of me
Then open me up and spit me out

Alexander wondered why
No life flashed before his eyes
Why his soul did not depart
Why he found no peace of mind
Would it take a little while
Was it the same for everyone
Alexander realized
That hell is found inside of me
And nothing else will set me free
If hell is found inside of me
Then open me up and spit me out
