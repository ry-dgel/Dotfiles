I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes
The Upper Peninsula and the television news
And I've seen my wife at the K-Mart
In strange ideas, we live apart

I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car
The window is broken out and the interstate is far
And I drove all night to find my child
In strange ideas, he's been reviled

In strange ideas, in stranger times
I've no idea what's right sometimes
I lost my mind, I lost my life
I lost my job, I lost my wife
