You see (do you see) the melting of our days (of our days)
In time (is there time) nothing ever stays (ever stays)

I let you go, you let me in, I want you
I let you go, you let me in, I want you

Around (all around) just long enough to touch (enough to touch)
This skin (touch your skin) turning into dust (into dust)
A song (it's our song) calling through the grass (through the grass)

I let you go, you let me in, I want you
I let you go, you let me in, I want you

Do you see... of our days? Is there time ever stays?
