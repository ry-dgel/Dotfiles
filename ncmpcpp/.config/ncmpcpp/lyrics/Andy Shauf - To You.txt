Jeremy can we talk a minute
I've got some things
That I need to get
Off of my chest
I know that we've had a few
And it's far too late
But if I wait
I might never tell you
Can we find somewhere quiet
Let's go outside
I've got some smokes
If you've got a light
It's just that sometimes when I'm by your side
It feels so right
It feels like nothing could go wrong
Does it ever
Feel like that to you
Does it ever
Feel like that to you
Oh I don't know what I mean
That sounded wrong
Man I'm just tired
I'm not being weird
I just mean that you're a good friend
It's hard to explain
Just forget I
Said anything
Oh get over yourself
I'm not in love with you
It just came out all wrong
Yea tell the guys
And laugh it up
Why am I even surprised
That it never
Feels like that to you
That it never
Feels like that to you
I guess it never
Feels like that to you
I guess it never
Feels like that to you
