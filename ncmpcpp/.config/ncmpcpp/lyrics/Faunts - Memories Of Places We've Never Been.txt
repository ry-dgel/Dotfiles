No time to decide how far this loyalty will stretch me
Long ago if it were up to me, who knows where I'd be
Had a need for a while before you left him, whose fault is it? We'll see
I'm not chained, free to leave, but what, what is there for me?

If I go, and I might, I'm not sure my happiness will be there
Oh well, I have to rest before we feel the need to go elsewhere
Have I died? I can't solve this, not in my care
Can one man make a difference to the task of one who's been there

Who will it hurt?
I am free to go
What will move me?
I don't really know.

No time to decide how far this royalty will stretch me
Long ago if it were up to me, who knows where I'd be
Had a need for a while before you left him, whose fault is it? We'll see
Well, I stay, free to leave, but what, what is there for me?

Who will it hurt?
I am free to go
What will move me?
I don't really know
Who will it hurt?
I am free to go, say
What will move me?
I don't really know

Who will it hurt?
I am free to go
What will move me?
I don't really know
