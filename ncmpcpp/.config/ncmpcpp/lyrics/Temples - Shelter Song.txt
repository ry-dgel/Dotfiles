(One night) You came on over to me
(Late night) We shared a drink or three
(Night night) I read a proverb to you
(That night) She left a room with a view

Take all the time, time that you want to
Make up your mind, mind how you go
Take me in time, time to the music
Take me away to the twilight zone

(Last night) We stayed up late in a dream
(My oh my) We read a play with no theme
(Lifetime) In which our love pursues
(My time) In which I spend with you

Now I know the lonely days are gone
Don't you know that I can see
Like a summer day that's always long
We repel the wet of tears

As the shadows lighten up the day
Through the cons we laugh away
Like a windy day that's always wrong
We take shelter where we can

(Last night) I came on over to you
(My oh my) We played a song or two
(Lifetime) I read a poem loud
(My time) I wrote a song for thee

Now I know the lonely days are gone
Don't you know that I can see
Like a summer day that's always long
We repel the wet of tears

As the shadows lighten up the day
Through the cons we laughed away
Like a windy day that's always wrong
We take shelter where we can
