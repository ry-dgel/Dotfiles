Go ahead and congratulate yourself
Give yourself a hand the hand is yours
And the eye that eyes itself is your eye
And the ear that hears itself is too near
Then you're getting too close to your source

You've done the impossible now
Took yourself apart
Made yourself invulnerable
No one can break your heart
So you break it yourself

Bring in your own
Break it yourself

Bring in your own
(I break it myself)

Go ahead and reionize yourself
Give yourself a hand the hand is yours
And you go ahead and wring it out
Go ahead and stretch it out
Go ahead and wear it inside out
Day trip in the desert makes this
Boy and girl too wise
Through a raging wall of sand that's
Hundred stories high
And you reionionionize
And it's eyeoneyeoneyeoneyeoneye
All this time it took to realize
That you could use some help
Bringing your heart breaking the shell
Bringing your heart breaking the shell
Go ahead and defibrillate yourself
Give yourself a hand the hand is yours
And you go ahead and wear it out
You go ahead and stretch it out
You go ahead and wear it inside out
And it's eyeoneyeoneyeoneye
And it's eyeoneyeoneyeoneye
