We felt a change in times and times are now tough
It wasn't really clear at first
The gentry men were also ones to admire
The fancy people were the same

Take a look
The only thing is that the numbers don't add up
Break from work
It's just a typical thing in which you need to comply

The plan is [?]

For working class the joy of drinking prevails
The types who open never close
Take a guess
The only thing is that the guesser is a mess
Walk on by
It's just a difficult time in which the people comply

It's a difficult time
Put your hands on the wall
Take a look at the scene that you conceive as paradise
Then just close your eyes
Hide away

It's a typical time
Maybe out of the sign
Take a gamble and make a little bet on paradise
And then close your eyes
Guess the way

To move a problem is to stay out of harm
Although the worry isn't gone
The working man is feeling under the weather
The peasant woman even worse

Take a look
The only thing is that the numbers don't have worth
Walk on by
It's just a seminal time
Such a terrible plight

Take a guess
The only thing is that the guesser is a mask
Walk on by
It's just a difficult time in which the people comply

It's a difficult time
Put your hands on the wire
Take a look at the scene that you conceive as paradise
Then just close your eyes
Find your way

It's a difficult time
Maybe out of the sign
Take a gamble and make a little bet on paradise
So close your eyes
Guess the way
