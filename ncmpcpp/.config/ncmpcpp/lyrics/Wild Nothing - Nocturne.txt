You wanna know me
hat's to know
o I amuse you
        
         
         When the night is slow
o your eyelids ever close
 
         
Caught spirits in your waking woes?

I know where to find you
Know where you go
And I just want to let you know
You can have me
You can have me all
You can have me
You can have me all

And you're twisted
What can I say
Your days are empty
And my tongue's decayed
And we stay up just
One more night of your company

I know where to find you
Know where you go
And I just want to let you know
You can have me
You can have me all
You can have me
You can have me all
