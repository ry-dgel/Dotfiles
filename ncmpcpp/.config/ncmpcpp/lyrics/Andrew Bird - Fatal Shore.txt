Would it be easier so much easier
If you never knew us
Would you ever fear anymore
If you never knew us
Would we meet on a fatal shore
On a fatal shore?

When are you comin to shore
To never fear anymore
You never know any doubt
Like we who breathe in and out

Are you a breather
Mail receiver?
If you could see right through us
Through our clothes and through our pores
If you could see right through us
You're gonna run into your homes and lock your doors
