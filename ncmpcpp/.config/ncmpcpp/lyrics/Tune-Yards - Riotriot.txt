I have a secret to tell youAbout the night I met youYou had come to put handcuffs on my brother          
           Down in the alleyway
I dreamt of making love to you
Up on the rooftop, looking up at the sky

Right before it happens,
There's no sign at all
One minute blue skies,
Then the rain begins to fall
Pop go the windows
Pop go the windows
So we can see you more clearly
Pop go the windows
So you can hear us
Through the night

Get real hot, blow your top
Get real hot, blow your top
Hiding in the alleyway
Get real hot, blow your top

They are writing and looking and they're knocking at your door
Who are you for
Who are you
Put your hand upon my heart, feel the beating of the wall
Who are you for
Who are you for
If you do nothing, you still do something
Do you see it
Do you see it
If you do nothing, you still do something
Do you feel me
Do you feel me

There is a freedom in violence that I don't understand
And like I've never felt before

Why did you come here
Why did you come here
Why did you come here
To our neighborhood
