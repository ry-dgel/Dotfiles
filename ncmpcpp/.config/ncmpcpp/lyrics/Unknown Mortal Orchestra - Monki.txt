He wants to give her everything she wants
All of the sins in her mind
All of her enemies falling and crying, yeah
All of the tear drops on her tongue
It's in her conscience that whatever God gives her someone to mourn
Who cares what God is or what a guitar is, or that you were born, ooh

Monki, monki, ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh-oooh, he wanted you
Monki, monki, ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh-oooh, he wanted you

And when he stops saying thing you want to hear
Pull up your knickers in a mood
He wants to outclass these crass devotees
Deletes your picture from his phone
It's in his conscince that musical notes give him, someone to mourn
Who cares what God is or what a guitar is, or that you were born, ooh

Monki, monki, ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh-oooh, she wanted you
Monki, monki, ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh-oooh, she wanted you

It's in his conscince that musical notes give him, someone to mourn
Who cares what God is or what a guitar is, or that you were born, ooh

Monki, monki, ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh-oooh, she wanted you
Monki, monki, ooh-ooh-ooh, oooh-oooh, she wanted you
