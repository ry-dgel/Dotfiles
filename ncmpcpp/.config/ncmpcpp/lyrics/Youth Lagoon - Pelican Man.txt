You wanted, you wanted,
To know that they could never survive.

There's blood in the carpet,
The basement, the attic.

You wanted, you wanted,
To know that they won't come back to life.

But they did, in a heartbeat,
And chased you down the concrete.

They are the mouths that you never fed.
Eighteen demons lie in your bed,
Questioning everything you've ever said.
It's not true, it's all in your head.
You are the pelican, you are the pelican man.
