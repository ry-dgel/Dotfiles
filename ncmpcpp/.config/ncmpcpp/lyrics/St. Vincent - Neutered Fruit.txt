Did you ever really stare at me? (x2)
Like I stared at you

I ate flowers in the backyard
Bought finely neutered fruit
Shot a hundred arrows at a knoll
A hundred sparrows blue

Did you ever really stare at me?
DId you ever really stare?
Did you ever really stare at me?
Like I stared at you

Don't run
Don't run little rabbit run
Don't run
Don't run little bunny run

Did you ever really stare at me?
Did you ever really stare?
Like I stared at you

Did you ever ride a bear for me?
Did you ever really care?
DId you ever really care for me?
Like I cared for you

Don't run away
