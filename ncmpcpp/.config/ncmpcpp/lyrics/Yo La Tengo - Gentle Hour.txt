It's such a pleasure to touch your skin
To touch your skin
It's such a pleasure to touch your heart
To touch your heart
I can hardly wait

I couldn't bare it, to live for fear
Undressing you
You're in my heart all the time
All the time
I will wait till you arrive
To make it to the grave
And I couldn't have done
Anything else

A gentle love
A gentle heart
A gentle love
A gentle heart

All things that cause you trouble cause pain

It's such a pleasure to touch your skin
To touch your skin
It's such a pleasure to touch your heart
I can hardly wait

And I'm waiting to hear you now
To make it to the grave
And I couldn't have done
Anything else
I couldn't have done anything else
