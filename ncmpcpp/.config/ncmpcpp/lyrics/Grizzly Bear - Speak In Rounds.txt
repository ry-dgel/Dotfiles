If I draw you upside down I can let go
Leaves my mind at ease gives me something to focus on
Could I be alone?
Could I be alone?

If I speak in rounds for a while letting my tongue swell
I'll be sure to try and explain myself to dispel
Blame it on the day
Blame it on the day

Step down just once learn how to be alone
Step down just once learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost what's left before it's gone

But what makes each step worth the time and regret still shows
In the cradle of my unruly jest you belong
Take it as it is
Make another fist

Step down just once learn how to be alone
Step down just once learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost what's left before it's gone
