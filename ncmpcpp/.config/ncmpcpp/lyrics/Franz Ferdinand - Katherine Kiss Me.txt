Katherine, kiss me
Slippy little lips will split me
Split me where your eye won't hit me
Yes, I love you, I mean I'd
I'd love to get to know you

Sometimes I say the stupid things, I think
I mean I
Sometimes I think the stupidest things
Mmmmmm
And do you ever wonder
How the boy feels

Katherine, kiss me
Flick your cigarette, then kiss me
Flick your eyes at mine so briefly
Your leather jacket lies
In sticky pools of Cider Blackberry

You glance a ricochet
From every alpha male behind me
Eyes
Like marbles on a washing machine

Mmmmm
I wonder
How the boy feels

Katherine, kiss me
In the alleyway
By JQ's
Jacket in the sodium light
Yes, I love you, I mean I
I mean I need to love

And though your opened eyes stared bored
Upon the overflowing pipes above me
Tonight
I don't mind
Because I never wonder
How the girl feels
