Just imagine a trip to a wonderful land
Of candy, and jam, and ice cream

I gotta hit that street you better watch it
With a gat that I cock with a full clip
I got the whip, got the clip, I keep it undercover
all up in the club just to live it up
See the stone cold face, try to knock it
I can't stop, I'm a rocket
I gotta be in it, I gotta be in it
I gotta be-ba-da-be-ba-da-be-da-be-it

See the big gold chain that I'm rockin'
I got the ring for the bling, not a problem
I got a stash full of cash that I owe to my brother
All up in the club, just to live it up
Watch the street turn cold when I walk it
It's my rules no man can stop it
I throw a kick so quick that'll leave you in the gutter
Leave you in the gutter, gutter, gutter...

All up in the club, all up in the gutter...
Just imagine, wonderful land
Why do all these things never happen
I'm just a random girl with gentle manners
If my dreams aren't rocked and I rule the wonderland...
All up in the club, all up in the gutter.
