Yonder stands my darling she's all dressed in white
A crown of flames around her head
And if I'm falling over you know she gets me right
And if I'm sick she carries me to bed

When I reach the other side
I'm gonna tell them how she treated me kind
Oh the worlds I have seen
And she's alright with me

With the song of Solomon upon her lips
The light of morning in her eyes
Jordan river in her graveyard hips
You know I'm bound to be baptized

When I see the rising sun
I'm gonna tell them all the good she's done
Oh the worlds I have seen
And she's alright with me

And all the wasted days I've spent
Giving thieves all of my time
I'm changing ways and
I'm leaving them behind
