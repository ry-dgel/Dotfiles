You've fallen once you'll fall again
And lean on
Your tired hands that crawl and grasp
The soft ground
By the look on your face
You set out on a path
Never to arrive
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes

Stretched out far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright so long
I'm never coming back

And every stone and every step
I won't recall
Emptied out of every thought
Just soft ground
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes

Gone at last
Stretched out
Far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright so long
I'm never coming back

It overflows
It overflows
It always runs
It overflows
It overflows
It always runs
Silver and silent
Endless abundance overflows

Silver and silent rushing on
Endless abundance overflows
Always surrounds you always glows
Look on your face
Burden's on your back
Sun is in your eyes

Stretched out
Far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright so long
I'm never coming back
