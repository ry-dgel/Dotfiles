He eats an avocado
Writes novels on her navel
Climbs out her bedroom window
While she's asleep

She speaks of venom cobras
Dark mater, supernovas
Car crashes and tsunamis
That bring the rain

He talks with great bravado
Drinks baby shirley temples
Fights with a palm of marbles
Does it hurt?  Does it hurt?

She squeeze the honey bottle
On an over-ripe tomato
Don't care when all the ants go
Right up her skirt

Nobody Knows
Where the time goes
Where the grind grows
Nobody knows

Nobody knows
Where the time goes
Where the grind grows
Nobody knows

They met one summer party
Eating banh mi with the cabbies
Throwing empties at the police
Oh how they laughed

She cut a smokey figure
She splintered in his fingers
So deep that even tweezers
Couldn't pull her out

They danced in tiny halos
Like moths around a candle
Or atoms too unstable
But they don't care

Nobody knows
Where the time goes
Where the grind grows
Nobody knows

Nobody knows
Where the time goes
Where the grind grows
Nobody knows

We leave a healthy corpse
We beat a dying horse
We leave the headlights on
We write a swan song

Will you get eulogized?
Will you have apologized?
Were you running high tonight?
Will you even care?

Nobody knows
Where the time goes
Where the grind grows
Nobody knows

Nobody knows
Where the time goes
Where the grind grows
Nobody knows

Nobody knows
Where the time goes
Where the grind grows
Nobody knows

Nobody knows
Where the time goes
Where the grind grows
Nobody knows

Nobody knows
Where the time goes
Where the grind grows
Nobody knows
