Darkness comes to murder the sunshineDarkness comes to help me believeThat we'll never again be together         
         
         Love has turned to summon the breeze  
         
Sorry you have lost your away
I will not be here to stay 
So long
Sorry you have lost your mind
Please don't me make me waste my life
So long

Darkness comes to murder the sunshine
Darkness comes to help me believe
That we'll never again be together
Love has turned to summon the breeze

I will never fall,
I will  never fall in love again

I will never fall,
I will never fall in love again

I will never fall, (I will never fall)
I will never fall in love again

I will never fall, (I will never fall)
I will never fall in love again

I will never fall, (I will never fall)
I will never fall in love again

(Don't you know it's someone else to be loved?)

I will never fall, (I will never fall)
I will never fall in love again
