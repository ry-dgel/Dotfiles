Play us like pawns and relentlessly confine,
Into living up to gender roles and having absent minds
Don't you think it's funny how they tell us how to live?
Don't you think it's funny how we're all delinquent kids?
Like, hush now, don't say, don't say

Hush boy, oh hush boy, don't say a word
Throw on a jersey and no one gets hurt
Hush girl, oh hush girl, just bat your eyes
Play our little game, play our little game

Bounded all thoughts and corrected common sense
You're raising suicidals with your predetermined titles
Like "a mess, distressed, I am unimpressed, you're excess
A dress is all you'll ever be."
Gender roles impose control and deceive progressive times
Welcome to the land of the broken minds

Hush boy, oh hush boy, don't say a word
Throw on a jersey and no one gets hurt
Hush girl, oh hush girl, just bat your eyes
Play our little game, play our little game [2x]

We feign opulence just to get by
Put on false confidence just to feel alive
They can't hurt me anymore
There's nothing left to break of me
There's nothing left to take from me
'Cause, baby, it's easy to fake a smile
When you've been doing it for a while
Baby, it's easy to fake a smile
When you've been doing it for a while

Hush boy, oh hush boy, don't say a word
Throw on a jersey and no one gets hurt
Hush girl, oh hush girl, just bat your eyes
Play our little game, play our little game [2x]

Hush boy, oh hush boy

Hush girl, oh hush girl

Play our little game
Play our little game
Play our little game
Play our little game
Play our little game,
Won't you play with me?
