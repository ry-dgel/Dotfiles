It's time to tango with the frisky, frosty Frosty Man
He's got a temperature of negative degrees again
He likes ice cream and Yo La Tengo with the jammin' pants
You got to cool it with the hipster costly Frosty Man
He's chillin', illin', thrillin' with the Mr. Saucy Pants
He likes to keep it real, he likes to talk a little sense
He's got a friend called Coolio, Vanilla Ice, and Ice Cube
Banana split and frozen pie and Mr. Frosty Pants

Mr. Frosty Man
Frosty, Frosty, Frosty, Frosty
Frosty Man

Don't get his goat, he just might melt, and then he gets all mean
When summer comes, he sits beside the air conditioning
But, Mr. Frosty, don't be bossy, winter's coming soon
And when it snows again, Frosty
