It's been almost twenty years on the Red Planet
​A place where there are no tears, it is just water floating
​No, they're not quite emoting
​
​I dream of the other days, of the times I held you
​Left in an autumn blaze, now I idle in bubbles
​Just collecting the rubble
​
​Well I waited for you out here, but that was just delusional
​And I've painted all these pictures of Earth, but that's unusual
​Unusual to you
​
​Met at a seminar, shared the same table
​Brushed by you at the bar, didn't match your description
​It soon became my prescription
​
​I think of the junipers in the spring growing
​Fall up on Jupiter, it doesn't draw a reaction
​Temporary distraction
​
And I've waited for you out here, but that may be delusional
And I've painted all these pictures of Earth, but that's unusual
Unusual to you
​​Unusual, unusual, unusual to you
​
And I waited for forever, and that was just delusional
So I've painted all these pictures of Earth, but that's unusual
Unusual, unusual, unusual to you
