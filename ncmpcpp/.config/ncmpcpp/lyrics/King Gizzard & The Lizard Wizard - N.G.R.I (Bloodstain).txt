Everyone thinks I am shallow
hen I'm hiding in my room
afe within my zone
        
         
         All the demons that I summon
ipe the blood off of the floor
 
         
Itâ€™s my only law

Sorry!
Whoo!

N, G
R, I
Mundane
Bloodstain
NGRI, in my brain
Keep a clean
Bloodstain

I've awoken from my slumber
I was dreamin' 'bout a flood
Covered in my blood
Now my pits are getting sweaty
It's a sign I've got to go
Back to where I know

Sorry!
Whoo!
Suffer endlessly
Suffer endlessly
Forever giving in to

N, G
R, I
Mundane
Bloodstain
NGRI, it's plain
Wipe it up
Bloodstain

N, G
R, I
Mundane
Bloodstain
NGRI, in my brain
Sweep a clean
Bloodstain
