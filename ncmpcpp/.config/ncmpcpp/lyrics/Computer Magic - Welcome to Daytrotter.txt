I Saw youBut I didn't really wat toI Found you

On the street at night

I left you
But I didn't really wat to
I bet you
Could find a better life

Cause I found out, found out
Yes I found out, found out
Cause I found out, found out
I found out

And I listen to you closely and I'm
Missing just you mostly (I just wanna)
Take a walk in the park and go
Strolling
When it's dark

I listen
But I never really want to, no
I'm christened
But I've sinned too many times

I left my bike
On the corner of elderidge and
It got stolen
And now I don't have a thing

Cause I found out, found out
Yes I found out, found out
Cause I found out, found out
I found out

And I listen to you closely and I'm
Missing just you mostly (I just wanna)
Take a walk in the park and go
Strolling
When it's dark

I never listen to a thing
I never listen to a thing
I never listen to a thing

Cause I found out, found out
Yes I found out, found out
Cause I found out, found out
I found out

And I listen to you closely and I'm
Missing just you mostly (I just wanna)
Take a walk in the park and go
Strolling
When it's dark
