Though our fathers' fathers slept in stolen houses
All that's over now
And our babies never cry
And we can look you in the eye
And say, "We're not afraid to die"

And yes, our mothers' mothers saw in black and white
But all that's over now
And our children never lie
And no matter how we try
We are not afraid to die
