God my god
My dog has a broken leg
Grip this, grab that, have that
An empty bag
Grip this, grab that, have that
An empty plug in

And ones a friend of mine
And ones a Gemini
And ones a friend of mine
Oh wait I’ll wait a while

Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy

Dig begin
This pad has a bigger grid
Grip this, grab that, have that
An empty bag
Grip this, grab that, have that
An empty plug in

At once a bend of mind
And one gets left behind
At once a bend of mine
Oh wait I’ll wait a while

Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
Really shouldn't bring that other guy
