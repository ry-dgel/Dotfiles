When we are dancing
And you're dangerously close to me
I get ideas, I get ideas.
I want to hold you
So much closer than I dare do.
I want to scold you
'Cause I care more than I care to.And when you touch me
with a fire in every finger
I get ideas, I get ideas.
And after we have kissed goodnight
and still you linger
I kinda think that you get ideas too.Your eyes are always saying
The things you'll never say
I think they could be saying
That you could love me too.
But that's the whole idea, it's true,
The lovely idea
That I'm falling in love with you.When we are dancing
And you're dangerously close to me
I get ideas, I get ideas.
I want to hold you
So much closer than I dare do.
I want to scold you
'Cause I care more than I care to.And when you touch me
with a fire in every finger
I get ideas, I get ideas.
And after we have kissed goodnight
and still you linger
I kinda think that you get ideas too.Your eyes are always saying
The things you'll never say
I think they could be saying
That you could love me too.
But that's the whole idea, it's true,
The lovely idea
That I'm falling in love with you.
