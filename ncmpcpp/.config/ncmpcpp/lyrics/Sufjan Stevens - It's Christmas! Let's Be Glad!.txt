Since it's Christmas, let's be glad
Even if your life's been bad
There are presents to be had

Take a walk out in the snow
And hear Santa's "Ho ho ho!"
He's got a million miles to go

La la la la la la ah

Sing a carol to your mom
Because she knows what's going on
And she knows if you've been bad or good

And if you get what you deserve
To be graded on the curve
Oh, you got a lot of nerve

La la la la la la ah

Since the year is almost out
Lift your hands and give a shout
There's a lot to shout about today

Since it's Christmas, let's be glad
Even if the year's been bad
There are presents to be had
A promotion for your dad
Don't be angry don't be mad
