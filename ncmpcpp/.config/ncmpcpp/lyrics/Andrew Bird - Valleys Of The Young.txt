Do you need a reason
We should commit treason
And bring into this world a son

And leave the valleys of the young
Valleys of the young
Valleys of brunch and tedium

Well, your friends will become strange to you
Just as you will become strange to them
You'll live across a great divide
And the problems that seem like luxuries
They're off getting stoned and hugging trees
All the things you'll be forsaking
Still our hearts are constantly breaking

From their cradle to our grave
Is it selfish, or is it brave?

Nana nanananana
Nananana
Nananana nanana

Do you need a reason we've
Been making all to become three
And believe in this holy valley

Land of brunch and misery
I'm living on
The valleys of the young

Now you're going on 64
Driving down 65, to the hospital
To see if your adult son will survive or not
After taking those pills in the parking lot
You know the one behind the Marriott
This is a dream you won't be waking
Still our hearts are constantly breaking

From their cradle to our grave
Is it selfish, is it brave?
From their cradle to our grave
Is it selfish or is it brave?
