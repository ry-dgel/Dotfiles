Do you find
It gets a little easier each time
You make it disappear?

Oh fools,
The magician bends the rules
As the crowd watches his every move

Just a shaking hand without a concrete plan

Sidesteps to a death defying feat
Wait for him to reappear
Look close, see him sweat the most
Each time his options disappear

Just a shaking hand without a concrete plan
Just a shaking hand without a concrete plan
I'm a shaking hand without a plan
