Now when you wake up
ight's falling someone is by your side
ull it together, darling you're not alone
        
         
ut when you break up
 
         
Sky's falling no one is on your side
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone

And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized
And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized

Just keep your lamp on

Now he's a dyin' bed maker
He's a dyin' bed maker Jesus gonna make my...
It's a holy ghost, holy ghost religion
It's a holy ghost religion Jesus gonna make my...

And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized
And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized

And when you wake up
Night's falling someone is by your side
Pull it together, darling you're not alone

But when you break up
Sky's falling no one is on your side
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone

And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized
