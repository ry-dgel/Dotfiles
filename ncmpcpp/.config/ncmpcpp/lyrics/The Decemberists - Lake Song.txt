Down by the lake
We were overturning pebbles
And upending all the animals alight

And I took a drag
From your cigarette and pinched it 'tween my finger and my thumb
Till it had died

And the sun burned low
On the radio

Say that you will
Say you will or will you won't or you whatever
You prevaricate your whole life, don't you?

And this much I can say
I would have waited till the oceans fell away and all the sunken cities would
Reveal themselves to you

But you won't will you?
Because you never do

And the sun burned through
Sweet as honeydew

And I
Seventeen and terminally fey
Well I wrote it down and threw it all away
Never gave a thought to what I'd paid

And you
All sibylline, reclining in your pew
You tattered me you tethered me to you
The things you would, and the things you wouldn't do
To tell the truth I never had a clue

Now we arise
To curse these young suburban villains
And their ill-begotten children from the lawn

Come to me now
And on this station wagon window set the ghosts of your two footprints that they might
Haunt me when you're gone

And when the light broke dawn
You were forever gone

But I remember you:
You were full...
You were full and sweet as honeydew

And I
Seventeen and terminally fey
Well I wrote it down and threw it all away
And never gave a thought to what I'd paid

And you
All sibylline, reclining in your pew
You tattered me you tethered me to you
The things you would, the things you wouldn't do
You notice now I never had a clue
Never had a clue
You were full and sweet as honeydew
You were full and sweet as honeydew
