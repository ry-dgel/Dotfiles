If you seek a pillow for your head
Or a fitted sheet for Christmas bed
If you see your shadow on the snow
Is it from the baby Jesus glow?
He's going to the country

Find a tree and put in your house
Put a mistletoe upon your mother's blouse
If you see a woman dressed in black
Give her up a song and then ask for it back
We're going to the country
We're going to the country
You're mom's going to the country
We're going to the country
The country
