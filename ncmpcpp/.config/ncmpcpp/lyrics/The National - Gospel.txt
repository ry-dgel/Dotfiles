I've got two armfuls of magazines for you
I'll bring them over
So hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
Hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
And I'll, I'll bring a nice icy drink to you

Let me come over, I can waste your time, I'm bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
And we'll play G.I. Blood, G.I. Blood
We'll stand by the pool, we'll throw out our golden arms

Darling, can you tie my string
Killers are calling on me

My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet

Darling, can you tie my string
Killers are calling on me

Stay near your, stay near your television
Set it up outside
And hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
Hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
And I'll, I'll bring a nice icy drink to you

Let me come over, I can waste your time, I'm bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
And we'll play G.I. Blood, G.I. Blood
We'll stand by the pool, we'll throw out our golden arms

Darling, can you tie my string
Killers are calling on me

My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet
My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet

Darling, can you tie my string
Killers are calling on me
Darling, can you tie my string
Killers are calling on me
