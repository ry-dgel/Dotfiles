See that big blue note over there on the counter
You Don't want to read that thing man, it's a real getcha downer
But don't you dare say nothin else bad about her
She's gone

No,no,no,no don-don't throw it away
'Cause tonight I might need it
It gets real lonely around here at night sometimes, and I have to reread it
Besides you can show it to the boys downtown, and they won't believe that,
She's gone

[CHORUS]
There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find just like that she's up and vanished
And the only thing she left behind for me

Is this big blue note folded up in my pocket
Yeah don't laugh, it's been two months I still got it

Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice
Just to make sure I ain't forgot that
She's gone

You know my psychiatrist said, "Tell me what do you see
When you look at these inkspots of reds and yellows and green?"
You know, I looked at them all, but all they looked to me like
Big blue notes

[CHORUS]
There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find just like that she's up and vanished
And the only thing thats left to do for me

Is stand high on this cliff overlooking the sea
With my big blue note paper airplane that I just set free
And I'm gonna wait here a few more minutes, and if it don't come back to me
You guessed it
She's gone

Crash landin
Bye, bye, baby
