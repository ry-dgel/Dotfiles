People downing in the middle of the parties again
Getting the cool with the happy, they went fire (fire)
Everybody talkin' bout the power of the gospel (everybody)
Getting the cool with the happy, they went fire

People downing in the middle of the parties again
Getting the cool with the happy, they went fire
Everybody talkin' bout the power of the gospel
Getting the cool with the happy, they went fire

Seems to feel that beat you can't stop bouncing
Why don't we keep the rhythm just what it sounds
Now people wanna stop the frenzied happening
But I need you to stop the sound to get it right
