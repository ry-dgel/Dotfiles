So now I am older 
Than my mother and father
When they had their daughter
Now what does that say about me?
 
Oh, how could I dream of 
Such a selfless and true love
Could I wash my hands of
Just looking out for me?
 
Oh man, what I used to be
Oh man, oh my, oh me
Oh man, what I used to be
Oh man, oh my, oh me

In dearth or in excess
Both the slave and the empress
Will return to the dirt, I guess 
Naked as when they came
 
I wonder if I'll see 
Any faces above me
Or just cracks in the ceiling
Nobody else to blame
 
Oh man, what I used to be
Oh man, oh my, oh me
Oh man, that I used to be
Oh man, oh my, oh me
 
Gold teeth and gold jewelry
Every piece of your dowry
Throw them into the tomb with me
Bury them with my name
 
Unless I have someday
Ran my wandering mind away

Oh man, what I used to be
Montezuma to Tripoli
Oh man, oh my, oh me
