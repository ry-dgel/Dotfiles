Hungry bread and butter hustle
You'll be doing it a while, livers only fail
Where's your relaxation?
Where's the time required for your health?
Been hating on my new perspective
Been hurrying along, no meal is ever done
You could win a rabbit
You can have a rabbit or a rib
The fast child is gonna have a dead hand
We can get him started, yeah

Bad mind, let me put on good habits
Been working and put on good habits
Sometimes I can't find my good habits

Oh, Spanish bands use all the echo
Persian kitty better stay out of the train
Glad you brought your food on
Eat it like it's gonna get away
Your coffee sure is getting colder
And seats are getting fewer, space is losing place
You could win a rabbit
You could kill a rabbit with a rib

Rabbit or a habit? Habit or a rib?
Rabbit or a habit? Habit or a rib?
Rabbit or a habit?
