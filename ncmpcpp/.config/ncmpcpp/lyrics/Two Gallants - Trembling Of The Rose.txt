Why must it come to this?
You disown me with a kiss
Another number on your list
Guess that's me

But oh girl, what have I done?
Another fool blind by the sun
No, which way shall I run?
Aimlessly

But look out now, I can't see straight
Just woke up and it's getting late
And I'm as full of hate
As I used to be

But in the hour of my demise
I'll recall your empty eyes
You know I died
The day you set me free

But what good is living for
When there's no knock on the door
No shelter from the war
Against me

But if you comfort me till dawn
I'd sing your lonesome song
Pack my things
I'll get gone faithlessly

But with your high heels and your mace
You tell me I'm out of place
Rip my eyes out of my face
With ease

And if I had one inch of pride
You took that too when you said goodbye
You know i died
The day you set me free

But I dreamt of you last night
And I woke to hate my life
Good God, I'm sick of sight
Can't you see?

But I must remain composed
'Neath the trembling of the rose
But you left me so exposed
Faithlessly

Who knows what is right or wrong?
Payed your debt and carry on
And no, I don't belong
That's plain to see

I guess I'll take your stress in stride
The hill is deep, the water's wide
You know I died
The day you set me free
