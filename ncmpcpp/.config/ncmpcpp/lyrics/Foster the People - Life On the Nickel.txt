Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time

I took the man and his horse
And ran before he looked up
I said the light's gonna change
But I'm calm and feeling warm
And now I'm sticking out my hands
And feeling weightless again

You got to push, got to shove 
I've got to eat before they eat me
Got the crown and the cup
I've got to write to my family
And say, "I'm calm and feeling warm."
I'm not quite there, but I'm close
And it's a world of a difference

Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time

I've got the worst all behind me
Yeah, they'll never be able to find me
I'm the king of the city
I'm a roach and they're all primates
This is meal time, real life
I'm not gonna fight
No, I'm gonna start a war

I've been right
I've been wrong
My smokes have come and gone
I've been crazy
Been fed enough to not wind up dead
And I'm lonely
My eyes have been closed to the world
'Cause the world's got nothing for me

Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time

Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time

Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
