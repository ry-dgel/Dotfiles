You say your time has come
You're tired of waking up
Don't be obscene, I can't conceive of
Living without you

You say you drag us down
No one should want you now

When I start to cry, you kiss my eyes and say
I'm not allowed to 

Burning beacon in the night 
Can't feel its heat, or see its light
That single solitary guide, it must get lonely there sometimes

You were a child forgot 
Lessons of love untaught
Now no embrace can quite replace 
The one that never found you

I was raised tenderly
All that was taught to me
I will apply, your parents tried but they didn't know how to

Burning beacon in the night 
Can't feel its heat, or see its light
That single solitary guide, it must get lonely there sometimes

Let me stand by you
The honor is mine
Let me stand by you
Loneliest light, loneliest light, loneliest light

Burning beacon in the night 
Can't feel its heat, or see its light
That single solitary guide, it must get lonely there sometimes
