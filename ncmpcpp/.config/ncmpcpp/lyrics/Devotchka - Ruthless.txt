Welcome my friends, bienvenidos
Let's get on with the show
Mes amis and mis amigos
Baby, it's time to go

Why you want to rely on the drugas
At least I know I'm alive
Anytime you want to use us
It's the only way we survive

Oh, what is wrong with us
Gravitas, hubris, hubris
Oh, you sound so ruthless
When you say I'm not the man I used to be
Now you're scared of me

Soliloquy of local anesthesia
A little something for the pain
A mild case of amnesia
I am drawing a blank

I'm done serving my sentence
I don't want to die on the vine
I'm not here for repentance
I have come for what's mine

Oh, what is wrong with us
Gravitas, hubris, hubris
Oh, you sound so ruthless
When you say I'm not the man I used to be
Now you're scared of me

You say I'm just being careless
It's a heightened state of awareness
I know that you couldn't care less
But I think this is quite serious

Tonight I see things so clearly
Descending black and white lines
Abandon those you hold dearly
Your calling is Divine

Vanishing, the thing is vanishing
Swallowed up by the earth
My darling what are you brandishing
I thought I was your first

Oh what is wrong with us
Gravitas, hubris, hubris
Oh you sound so ruthless
When you say it's time
To step out of the way
(Another time, another place)

The time has come we must be on our way
(Another time, another place)
The time has come to stand out of the way
(Another time, another place)

The time has come we must be on our way
(Another time, another place)
The time has come to stand out of the way
