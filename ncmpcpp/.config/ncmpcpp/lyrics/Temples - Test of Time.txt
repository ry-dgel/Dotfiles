The flower falls from an elegant tree
And scattering nature seed
And as the leaves fall after the rain
The soil will always fade
And as the water drips down from the top
From the veil oh I can't be touched.
The message reads like a like an marrying rhyme
As we stand through the test of time

Standing the test of time, wondering what
Standing the test of time, gathering what

Into the night, we are high; never mind,
And through the clouds, we arrive, like the skies in strike,
And as we dance on the stones, glass beneath our feet,
And from the clouds, be alive, nature speak.

The hour ends in a soggy sound
As the trees full of fall falls down
And then the leaves drip golden sand
The lettering breaks again
And the river brings up from the top
From the heaven that I forgot
And there's a tree that's like a marrying end
As we stand through the test of time

Standing the test of time, wondering what
Standing the test of time, gathering what
Standing the test of time, wondering what
Standing the test of time, gathering what

Into the night, we are high; never mind,
And through the clouds, we arrive, like the skies in strike,
And as we dance on the stones, glass beneath our feet,
And from the clouds, be alive, nature speak.

Standing the test of time, wondering what
Standing the test of time, gathering what
Standing the test of time, wondering what
Standing the test of time, gathering what

Into the night, we are high; never mind,
And through the clouds, we arrive, like the skies in strike,
And as we dance on the stones, glass beneath our feet,
And from the clouds, be alive, nature speak.
