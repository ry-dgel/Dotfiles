Get dressed in your bed
While she's asleep
It isn't right
But it isn't hard

Tell me, tell me won't you understand
Show me, show me, show me a better plan

It's summer lies
It's someone else's nothing
Here it comes now

You ask me to stay
You ask me to stay
You ask me to stay
But there's a million reasons to leave

Find a job
Find a friend
Find a home
Find a dog
Settle down
Out of town
Find a dream
Shut it down

Please, please don't point it that way
It's just a trigger that goes once
And you'll be unafraid

I wish that I'd been noticed, but it never goes that way
The silence that you brought has gone, gone, gone

Tell me, tell me, won't you understand?
Show me, show me, show me
You ask me to stay
You ask me to stay
You ask me to stay
But there's a million reasons to leave

Show me what to say
Show me what to be
Show me what to see
Show me what to be

Find a job
Find a friend
Find a home
Find a dog
Settle down
Out of town
Find a dream
Shut it down

I don't wanna tell you, darling, no
I don't wanna be in bed without your loving either

But I waited for your loss
Can't you wait for all this?
