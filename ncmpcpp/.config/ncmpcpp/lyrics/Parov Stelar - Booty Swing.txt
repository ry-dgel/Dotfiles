Araby sheikhs on the burning sands
Come into their harems and clap their hands
Say, "Come on, girls, are you ready to play?
Let's have a little more of that swingin' today"
Now, in the land of Fu Manchu
The girls all now do the Suzie-Q
Clap their hands in the middle of the floor
Saying, "Ching, ching, chop-suey, swing some more!"

Now, geisha girls in old Japan
Wink behind their peacock fans
Since they learned to say, "Yeah!
Let's swing it like Amelican's swing swing dance!"

Now, Gypsy caravans have changed their mode
They truck down the Romany road
With their hi-de-hos, and their hey-hey-diddle
Doin' the swing on the Gypsy fiddle

Them eastern wisemen know the story
Of the swing with Oriental glory
They stroke their beards and grin
Sayin', "Swing, little children, till the dawn comes in!"
Now, geisha girls in old Japan
Wink behind their peacock fans
Since they learned to say, "Yeah!
Let's swing it like Amelican's swing swing dance!"

Gypsy caravans have changed their mode
They truck down the Romany road
With their hi-de-hos, and their hey-hey-diddle
Doin' the swing on the Gypsy fiddle
