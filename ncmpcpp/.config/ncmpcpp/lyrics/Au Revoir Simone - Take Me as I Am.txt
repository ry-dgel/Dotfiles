Do you know when you were already born
Do you know this is the way it would be
Do you know when you were already born
You were already you and I already me

So take me as I am
Take me as I am

I know
It's easier said than done
But we've talked a million hours
To end up just where we begun
In this time we're passing
With these distractions
We could be having fun

So take me as I am
Take me as I am
Forget your plans

Do you know when you were already born
Do you know this is the way it would be
Do you know when you were already born
You were already you and I already me

So take me as I am
Take me as I am
Forget your plans
