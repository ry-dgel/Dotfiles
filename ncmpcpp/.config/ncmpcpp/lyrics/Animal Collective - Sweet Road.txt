Higher (Huh? No)
Higher (Huh?)

It started like a stone
I grew it out but then I rested it, I found sweet road
It came out of us on the right
I left my purse but found the road

I'm painted in a patchy problem (I found sweet road)
None can tell what I can tell, nuh-uh (I found sweet road)
Let them eagles have a good time (I found sweet road)
It's a road and not a soda (I found sweet road)

I found sweet road, I found sweet road
I found sweet road, I found sweet road
I found sweet road, I found sweet road
I found sweet road, I found sweet road

It started like a stone
I grew it out but then erased it, I found sweet road
It came out of us on the right
I left my purse then found the road
