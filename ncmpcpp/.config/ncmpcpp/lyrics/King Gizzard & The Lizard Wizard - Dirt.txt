Handshakes and bitter rows
re the common conjecture
 can dissect anything
        
         
         And save the skin for later
  
         
I know its just a time
And things will get better
But I don't mind much anyway
Vampire reflection

Gestured in our selfish understanding
Tensions only surface when you're hurt
Like a magpie's morning monologue
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt

Make time to say you're right
You should already know this
With next to no pretension
Still I'm walking on egg shells

Catch your breath, I'm heading out
Be sure others will notice
This is just a product of
Lack of reflection

Like a magpie's morning monologue
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt
