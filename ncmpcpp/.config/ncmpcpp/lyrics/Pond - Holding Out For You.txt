What in the world ever made that young girl cry,

the tears down her cheeks, she tries to hide.

and what of the man who passes calmly by, ohh I don't know.

Oh lies are no longer needed,

he frankly conceded.

I am not the way,

that you had hoped and prayed.

Sorry if I've caused you any pain,

but please believe me when I try to say,

I feel as if I'm going insane,

Oh it'll be better off this way.

I was holding out for you (x4)
