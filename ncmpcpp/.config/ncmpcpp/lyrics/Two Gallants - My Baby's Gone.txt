My baby breaks by the sea
Floats her arms around me
Well, they pretend to be free
She don't mean nothin' to me

This broken opera just screams
What don't get said in my dreams
Don't need no shoulders to lean
Still I feel far too clean

My baby's beauty explodes
My wounded conscience unloads
I go where cold winds don't blow
I go where nobody goes

But now my wave breaks down on me
Whole world seems out to sound me
I'll drown, no one to show me
Can't swim, I lost my floaties

My baby's gone
My baby's gone
My baby's gone
My baby's gone

My baby's gone
My baby's gone
My baby's gone
My baby's gone
