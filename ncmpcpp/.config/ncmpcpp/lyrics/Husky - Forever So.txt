Twinkling sky, fresh fallen snow
Tonight is cold, don't let me go
The sky is clear and we both know
The night is fast

Lipstick smile, mascara eyes
Remember me until you die
When she laughs I ask her why
'Cause time is fast

Come to me now
Morning's here
Scattered remnants
Cigarettes and beer
Don't ask why, why, why

Look out east, the morning glow
Watch me westward as I go
We shall be forever so
Looking back
