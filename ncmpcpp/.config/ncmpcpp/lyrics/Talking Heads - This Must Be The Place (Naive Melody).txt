Home
Is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I feel numb
Born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun

The less we say about it, the better
We'll make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong
Nothing

Oh
I got plenty of time
Oh
You got light in your eyes

And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money, always for love
Cover up and say good night
Say good night

Home
Is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home
She lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place

I can't tell one from another
Did I find you or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be
Where I'll be

Oh
We drift in and out
Oh
Sing into my mouth

Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home and
Share the same space for a minute or two

And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes that light up
Eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head
I go ooh
