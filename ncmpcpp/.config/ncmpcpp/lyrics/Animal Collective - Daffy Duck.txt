What I need is good advice
Cooked on plates of ground meat
Rubber hands and silly friends
Pasted on my wall

Someone sold a sweet sea soup
That I could swim in proudly
We might swim like laughing ducks
In your pink lagoon

There we go
Changing kin (Again)
There you go again

My hands can make yours warm again
If not absorbed in blankets
Are you in need of teething
A nibble on your neck?

If I had volcano boots
For swimming in volcanoes
Do you know the origins of laughing ducks?
What's the matter with those birds?

There we go
Changing kin (Again)
There you go again

What you need's a happy farm
With happy goats and sheep
What I need's a happy arm
To swing you 'round like father
