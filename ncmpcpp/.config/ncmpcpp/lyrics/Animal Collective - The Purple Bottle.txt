I've got a big, big, big heartbeat, yeah, I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days, think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways
With good friendly homes

You get me freaked freaked freaked on Preakness
I've never met a girl that likes to drink with horses, knows her Chinese ballet
I must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains but could you show my purple gaze
A thing or two at night?

It'd make me sick, sick, sick, to kiss you and I think that I would vomit
But I'll do that on Mondays, I don't have to work away
I like it when I bump you, an accident's a truth gate, I'm humbled in your pretty lens
I'll hold you, don't you go

Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet, Hallelujah
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know

Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Could we live together and agree on the same wares?
A trapeze is a bird cage and even if it's empty, it definitely fits the room
And we would too

And my dear dear dear Khalana, I talk too much about you
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Let's just talk together, you and me and me and you and if there’s nothing much to say
Well, silence is a bore

I've gotta big, big, big heartbeat, yeah, I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days, think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways
With good friendly homes

Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet, Hallelujah
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know
Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me, Hallelujah
Sometimes I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked, well, hello

Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part

Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part

Gotta crush high, thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I crushed your hand
Crush high, don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop

And you couldn’t really know 'cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high then I go and take some pills
'Cause I cant do all of my dose and still feel ill

You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that

Gotta crush high, thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I crushed your hand
Crush high, don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop

And you couldn’t really know 'cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high then I go and take some pills
'Cause I cant do all of my dose and still feel ill

You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that

Gotta crush high, thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I crushed your hand
Crush high, don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop

And you couldn’t really know 'cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high then I go and take some pills
'Cause I cant do all of my dose and still feel ill

Woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo

You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that
