This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
Till we're at the end of just another day

Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never felt something so close I couldn't keep
Into the day the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear?

Everything is changing
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here

Well, am I getting closer?
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
Do I really need it?
Wish that I'd remember
And I'm on the outcome (This could be the day that we push through)
Did I really want it?
Does it really matter? (It could be the day that all our dreams come true)
It was only yesterday
Didn't even know you (Oh it feels so real in my sleep, never felt so good, so close I do)
Now I'm gonna miss you

Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
It's the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mom
But she'll just be excited
