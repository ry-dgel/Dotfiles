Silhouette in white sun
Suddenly the sight of
Color everywhere 
A flower whispers in your ear
The story of its origin 
Near Sundance Sea
I see your listening
Your Look with me
And all I see is new 
A flowerâ€™s scent 
Changes our path 
Songs of birds 

Describe the light 
In the presence 
And absence of light 
Butterflies wind 
around each other as they rise 
We see a beauty only we have seen 

I see it in you, you see it in me
