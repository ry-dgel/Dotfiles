I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah
I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah

I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby this is explosive
I wanna raise pulses

I'm coming for your rhythm, I'm here to wake you up
I wanna be your hero, I wanna shake the fluff
I be on that beating in your chest
Check a stethoscope run a few tests
Something you can measure doesn't make it better
Feeling weighed down did you lose your girl, get her

You got a heart that's born with a beat
What's that now, you forget how to breathe?
I wanna get that thing runnin'

I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah
I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah

Oh I'm a make sure that you feel alive
I'm a make sure that you feel alive
I'm a make sure, I'm a make sure
I'm a make sure that you feel alive

I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby this is explosive
I wanna raise pulses

They run you through the system, they blowing you the smoke
They try to suffocate, but think before you choke
You control the beating in your chest
You resuscitate now, cardiac arrest
World you can have it, take a couple planets
Trade up your half for the whole pomegranate

You got a heart that's born with a beat
What's that now, you forget how to breathe?
I wanna get the thing runnin'

I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah
I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah

Oh I'm a make sure that you feel alive
I'm a make sure that you feel alive
I'm a make sure, I'm a make sure
I'm a make sure that you feel alive

I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby this is explosive
I wanna raise pulses

Oh I'm a make sure that you feel alive
I'm a make sure that you feel alive
I'm a make sure, I'm a make sure
I'm a make sure that you feel alive

I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby this is explosive, explosive

I-I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby this is eplosive
I-I wanna raise pulses
