Grow up children, don't you suffer
At the hands of one another?
If you like a sleeping demon
Listen, can you hear him weeping?
Tears of joy and tears of sorrow
He buys love to sell tomorrow

My life ain't no holiday
I've been through the point of no return
I've seen what a man can do
I've seen all the hate of a woman too

Feel your heartbeat, lose the rhythm
He can't touch the world we live in
Life is short but love is strong
There lies a hope that I have found
And if you try you'll find it too
Remember why I'm telling you

My life ain't no holiday
I've been through the point of no return
I've seen what a man can do
I've seen all the hate of a woman too

And they gave him away
Like in Whistle Down the Wind
By the look on his face
He never gave in
