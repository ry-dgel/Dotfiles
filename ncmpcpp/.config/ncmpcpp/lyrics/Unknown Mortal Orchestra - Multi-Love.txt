Multi-Love
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room
Who is your God? Where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko
She don't want to be a man or a woman
She wants to be your love

Multi-Love
All of the other stalker daughters dragged her under
May all her minds be made up
I'll be your Vicodin, expired and escaped to Valhalla
She don't want to be a man or a woman
She wants to be your love

Multi-Love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama what have you done to me
I'm half crazy

Multi-Love
It's not that this song's about her
All songs are about her
Sun shines underneath us
Fearing new kinds of mind control and just blaming each other
She don't want to be a man or a woman
She wants to be your love

Multi-Love
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room
Who is your God? Where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko
She don't want to be a man or a woman
She wants to be your love

Multi-Love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama what have you done to me
I'm half crazy

Multi-Love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama what have you done to me
I'm half crazy
