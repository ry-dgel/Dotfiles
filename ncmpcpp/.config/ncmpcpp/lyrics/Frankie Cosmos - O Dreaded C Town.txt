If you really need to stay inside
just to be sure you don't break anything
please don't invite me over
cause I don't think it is working
Today I walk through your town
it's ruin for me now
I still think you're in every van
And appear in all of them
You're a dealer a friend a prick a friend
Again with more to it
Now you're a ghost, a memory
Or maybe just a bad story
Where are you now ?
I don't really care
Who you're around,
Who you're making scared
I don't know or care to know
I don't care or know to care
