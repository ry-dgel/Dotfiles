Baby you should know by now that I'm right, for you.
But every time I step to you, you change
Your tune.
Sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breath
I step to the right, you move to the left.
Unless no one else.
I'd rather die to myself.

Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess.
I'm starting to unwind.
I been trippin' over you.
So tell me something new.
Take it or leave it.

Maybe I should pack my things and move on?
Maybe I'm foolin' myself and you're already gone?
Watching the flames wither and fade.
Trying to make sense of the look on your face.
I'm down on my knees
Just prayin' that I can hold on.

Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess.
I'm learning to unwind.
I've been trippin' over you.
So tell me something new.
Take it or leave it.

Baby please.
Oh baby please.
Stay with me or cut me free.
It's all of me.
Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess.
I'm starting to unwind.
I been trippin' over you.
So tell me something new.
Take it or leave it.
Take it or leave it
