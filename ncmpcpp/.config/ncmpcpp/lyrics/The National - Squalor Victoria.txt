Underline everything, I'm a professional
In my beloved white shirt
Underline everything, I'm a professional
In my beloved white shirt

I'm going down among the saints

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria, Squalor Victoria
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria, Squalor Victoria

Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools
Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria, Squalor Victoria
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria, Squalor Victoria

I'm going down among the saints

3:30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out
3:30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out

This isn't working, you, my middlebrow fuck-up
