Wolf criss-cross dying lawns
Sniffs hard on garbage can
Watch baby sleeping long
Through the window
Through the moon glow

Wolf squeeze through cellar doors
Paws pad on open floors
Claws slide up carpet stairs
Watch baby sleeping long

Wolf snake through a sea of toys
Teeth grind out a soothing song
Watch baby toss and turning
Evil gets what
Evil wants yeah

Where's you gloom at?
Where's your doom mat?
Will you harness the six six seven?
Are you dreaming of young Danzig?
Will he harness the six six six?

If you won't reinvent yourself
You can't circumvent your Hell

If you won't reinvent yourself
You can't circumvent your health

If you won't reinvent yourself
You can't circumvent your Hell

If you won't reinvent yourself
You can't circumvent yourself

Wolf cuts loose in the barrio
Lemon vodka mixed with churros
Scratched the 8 ball watching girls blow
Through the window
Through the moon glow

Baby dance inside his belly
Grooving to a cumbia beat
Teethes out a soothing melody
Evil gets what
Evil wants yeah

Where's you gloom at?
Where's your doom at?
Will you harness the six six seven?
Are you dreaming of young Danzig?
Will you harness the six six six?

If you won't reinvent yourself
You can't circumvent yourself

If you won't reinvent yourself
You can't circumvent yourself

If you won't reinvent yourself
You can't circumvent yourself

If you won't reinvent yourself
You can't circumvent yourself
