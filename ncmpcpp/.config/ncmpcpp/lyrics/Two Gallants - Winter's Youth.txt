In the winter of your youth,
ith a string tied 'round your tooth,
our mother slammed the door,
         
           Don't wanna hear no more,
Don't wanna hear no more.

From the corners of your mouth,
As the truth came wandering out,
You long for something else,
Your life up on the shelf,
Your life up on the shelf.

Out upon the open road,
You learned to say goodbye,
Such a lovely day to die.
All these things I have seen,
Within your two blue eyes.

In the silence of this town,
As the truth came wandering round,
Your neighbour slams the door,
Don't wanna hear no more,
Don't wanna hear no more.

Out upon the open road,
You learned to say goodbye,
Such a lovely day to die.
All these things I have seen,
Within your two blue eyes.
