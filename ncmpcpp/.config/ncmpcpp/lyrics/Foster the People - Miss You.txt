Forget your problems
You lay it down, they start up
The innocence of what you are
Is what I want
I've ran my colors
Dripped down and drained out
Tried a million things
But my heart's been shot

I hope you try to find me
I'm all spun and pacing
I know what you want to say here
So say it
Forget the words I'm speaking
Just want to rearrange 
So I'll just say it

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Smile at the chance just to see you again 
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Heat stroke, death's like
The wrong things that I think are right
I never knew that I could go as far as this
I took a problem recently forgotten
I know who I had been before I slipped
Oh, I want to change it
I will live a life that makes you smile
When I'm done here and long gone
Feverish and peaking
Just want to see your face
Oh whatcha say, whatcha say?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Smile at the chance to just to see you again
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Just look at me now 
Before I walk away
You just might miss me, miss me one day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
