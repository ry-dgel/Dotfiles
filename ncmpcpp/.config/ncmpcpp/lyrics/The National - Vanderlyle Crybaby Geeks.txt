Leave your home
Change your name
Live alone
Eat your cake

Vanderlyle crybaby, cry
Though the water's a-rising, there's still no surprising you
Vanderlyle crybaby, cry
Man, it's all been forgiven, swans are a-swimmin'

I'll explain everything to the geeks

All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love

Vanderlyle crybaby, cry
Though the water's a-rising, there's still no surprising you
Vanderlyle crybaby, cry
Man, it's all been forgiven, swans are a-swimmin'

I'll explain everything to the geeks

Hanging from
Chandeliers
Same small world
At your heels

All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love

Vanderlyle crybaby, cry
Though the water's a-rising, there's still no surprising you
Vanderlyle crybaby, cry
Man, it's all been forgiven, swans are a-swimmin'

I'll explain everything to the geeks
I'll explain everything to the geeks
I'll explain everything to the geeks
