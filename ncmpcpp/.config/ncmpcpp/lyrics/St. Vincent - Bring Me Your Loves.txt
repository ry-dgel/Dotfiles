Bring me your loves
All your loves, your loves
I wanna love them too, you know

I thought you were like a dog
I thought you were like a dog
But you made a pet of me

Bring me your loves
All your loves, your loves
I wanna love them too, you know

I, I took you off your leash
I, I took you off your leash
But I can't, no I can't make you heel
Bring me your loves
Bring me your loves

We both have our rabid hearts
Feral from the very start

Bring me your loves
All your loves, your loves
I wanna love them too, you know
