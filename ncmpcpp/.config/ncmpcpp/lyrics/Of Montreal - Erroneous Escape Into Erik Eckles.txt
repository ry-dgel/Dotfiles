The octopus in your purse
is cursing like an evil sailor
But remember the knife is worse
for the editors of movie trailers

And if you want me to
I'll help it's all the same to me
just tell me if you want me to

If you keep killing God in your eye
people will think you're really callous
But no matter how hard you try
you'll never be as weird as Uncle Alice

And if you want me to
I'll help it's all the same to me
just tell me if you want me to

I'm not upset just confused and it's so tough
I can't relate to this world I'm not bored enough
Watch out the music will complete the change in you

To sing this song in braille
you have to be haunted by glass freckles
And if your color treatment fails
well you can always talk to Erik Eckles
