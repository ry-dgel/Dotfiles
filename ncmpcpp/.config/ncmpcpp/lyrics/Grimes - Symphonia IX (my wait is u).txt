I try, I try
To make you cry
And make you love me

Oh, I would say yes
Oh, I would say yes

The need to be the best before
The need to rest

Oh, I would say yes
Oh, I would say yes

See, my wait is you
My wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you and I won't go on

See, my wait is you
My wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you and I won't go on

To make the pain, to feel the flame can be trying
Oh, I would say yes
Oh, I would say yes

So as you fade away alive
I lay dying
Oh, I would say yes
Oh, I would say yes

See, my wait is you
My wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you and I won't go on

See, my wait is you
My wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you and I won't go on
