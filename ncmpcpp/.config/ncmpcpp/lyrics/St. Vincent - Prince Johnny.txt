Prince Johnny, you're kind but you're not simple
By now I think I know the difference
You wanna be a son of someone

Remember the time we went and snorted
That piece of the Berlin Wall that you'd extorted
And we had such a laugh of it?
Prostrate on my carpet

You traced the Andes with your index
And bragged when and where and who
You gonna bed next
All with sons of someones
All with sons of someones

Saw you pray to all
To make you a real boy
Saw you pray to all
To make you a real boy

Prince Johnny, you're kind but do be careful
By now I know just when to stand clear
When all your friends and acolytes 
Are holding court in bathroom stalls

Where you pray to all
To make you a real boy
Saw you pray to all
To make you a real boy

But honey don't mistake my affection
For another spit and penny-style redemption
Cause we're all sons of someones
We're all sons of someones
I wanna mean more than I mean to you
I wanna mean more than I meant to him

So I pray to all
To make me a real girl
So I pray to all
To make me a real girl
So I pray to all 
All
All
All
