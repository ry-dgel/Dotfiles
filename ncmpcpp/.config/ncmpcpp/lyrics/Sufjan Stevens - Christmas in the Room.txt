No travel plans, no shopping malls
No candy canes, no Santa Claus
For as the day of rest draws near
It's just the two of us this year

No silver bells or mistletoe
We'll kiss and watch our TV show

I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
Till it's Christmas in the room

No traffic jams, no ice and storm
Far in the house the fire is warm
No Christmas tree, no great parade
It's just an ordinary day

No parties planned, no place to go
It's just the two of us alone
And in the house we see a light
That comes what we feel inside

I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
Till it's Christmas in the room
Till it's Christmas in the room

Oh, I can see the day when we'll die
But I don't care to think of silence
For now I hear you laughing
The greatest joy is like the sunrise

No gifts to give, they're all right here
Inside our hearts, the glorious cheer
And in the house we seek a light
That comes from what we know inside

I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
Till it's Christmas in the room

I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
Like it's Christmas in the room
Like it's Christmas in the room
