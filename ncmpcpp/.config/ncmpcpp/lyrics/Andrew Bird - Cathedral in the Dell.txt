The cathedral in cologne looks like a spaceship
Like the hand of god falling from the sky
A thousand stone-carved saints hang like icicles
But icicles don't take a thousand years to die

And all of us who worked on this cathedral
Or even spent a moment passing by
All of us are swept away like breadcrumbs
What comfort does it bring soaring towers left behind
Towers left behind

But there's a fiberglass castle in wisconsin
Where kids race go-karts around a moat
Once we went off there in december
And all the water slides and fudge shops were closed

Looking to find love under the ice machine
But all we did was drink in empty bars
Stumblin' drunk, we crawled back to our hotel room
I fell against you and felt your beating heart
I felt your beating heart

Where the snow is slowly falling on the ice machine
And the moon shone hazy through the pines
Lawn chairs are thrown into an empty pool
A dog chained to a tree, barking at the sky
Towers left behind
