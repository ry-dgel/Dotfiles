Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied I knew it was just stable children
Trying hard not to realize I was sitting right behind them

Oh dear, can't you see it's them, it's not me?
We're not enemies, we just disagree
If I was like him, all pissed in this bar
He changes his mind, says I went too far
We all disagree I think we should disagree, yeah

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
