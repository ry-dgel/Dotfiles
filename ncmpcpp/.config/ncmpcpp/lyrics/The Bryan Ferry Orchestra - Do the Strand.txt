There's a new sensation
A fabulous creation
A danceable solution
To teenage revolution
Do the strand love
When you feel love
It's the new way
That's why we say
Do the strand
Do it on the tables
Quaglino's place or Mabel's
Slow and gentle
Sentimental
All styles served here
Louis seize he prefer
Laissez-Faire Le strand
Tired of the tango
Fed up with my fandango
Dance on moonbeams
Slide on rainbows
In furs or blue jeans
You know what I mean
Do the strand
Had your fill of quadrilles
The Madison and cheap thrills
Bored with the beguine
The samba isn't your scene
They're playing our tune
By the pale moon
We're incognito
Down the lido
And we like the strand
Arabs at oasis
Eskimos and Chinese
If you feel blue
Look through who's who
See La Goulue
And Nijinsky
Do the strand sky
Weary of the waltz
And mashed potato schmaltz
Rhododendron
Is a nice flower
Evergreen
It lasts forever
But it can't beat strand power
The sphinx and Mona Lisa
Lolita and Guernica
Did the strand
