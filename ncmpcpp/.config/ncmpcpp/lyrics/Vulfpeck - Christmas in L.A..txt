On Christmas morning, on Christmas dayKris Kringle's driving a ChevroletHe left his reindeer, he went down south

He just had to see what it's all about

Wrapping presents out in the sun
Stuffing stockings, having some fun
Reading, writing, Christmas is here
Cali-fornia, Yuletide cheer
All the little children and all the big children, it's Christmas (in L.A.)
All the ladies and all the little babies, it's Christmas (in L.A.)
Even the gentlemen, every single one of them, Christmas (in L.A.)
In L.A

Oh, everyone around the world
Every boy and every girl
It's time to say
It's time to say
It's time to say

All the little children and all the big children, it's Christmas (in L.A.)
All the ladies and all the little babies, they were singing in the room (in L.A.)
Even the gentlemen, every single one of them, Christmas (in L.A.)
In L.A

All the little children and all the big children, it's Christmas (in L.A.)
All the ladies and all the little babies, it's Christmas (in L.A.)
Even the gentlemen, every single one of them, Christmas (in L.A.)
