I lie on a sofa awake it's what you said last night
You'd like us on top of a cake, but you won't let me take a bite
Flowers arriving in fleets, can't we talk about this
Why let the state in our sheets can't we do without it
Well I don't mean to wind you up, but I'd like to slow it down
How do I remain a pup, if you put be in a gown

What's it got to do with you, what's it got to do with me,
How could I lose control, when you're driving from the backseat
What's it got to do with you, what's it got to do with me,
How could I lose control, when you're driving from the backseat
Corners begin to repeat, I think we're getting lost
We walked to the end of the street, but we were bitten by the frost
So if you have to thaw me out, you can put me in a pail
Can we take another route, I don't want to wear a vail

What's it got to do with you, what's it got to do with me,
How could I lose control, when you're driving from the backseat
What's it got to do with you, what's it got to do with me,
How could I lose control, when you're driving from the backseat
I'll wait in the lobby for someone to show,
And if they don't come, I will know where to go
The bodies are lined up outside in the hall,
I don't want to decay in a mall

If everything you say is true, then why would I disagree how could I lose control
What's it got to do with you, what's it got to do with me,
How could I lose control, when you're driving from the backseat
When you're driving from the backseat
