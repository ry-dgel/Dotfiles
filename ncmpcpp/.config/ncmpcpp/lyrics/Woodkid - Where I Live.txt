I've never seen the Nothern lights,
I've never seen the snow
I never walked across the ice
I ignore the ocean's flow

Where I'm born is where I'll die
Where I live is where I cry

My children left on a cold night
My husband said it's how things go
Like rabbits blinded by the light
Kids want a better place to grow

Where I'm born is where I'll die
At night I shiver and I try
To forget that I never cheated
That I tried to be strong
No matter how wise I was, I feel wrong
To forget that I never followed
That man that I adored
Who promised me pretty sins and gold

And I'm waiting for the sun
And I'm waiting for the sun

I will never be out of sight
I'll never feel the snow
I'll never reach the truth of lies
I'm just watching my flowers grow

Where I'm born is where I'll die
At night I can't sleep when I try
To forget that I never cheated
That I tried to be strong
No matter how wise I was, I feel wrong
To forget that I never followed
That man that I adored
Who promised me pretty sins and gold

And I'm waiting for the sun
And I'm waiting for the sun
