Surely there is no substitute for company
My, mom's ripping off her hands one flake at a time
All her children left the house and left her all alone
Just like she'd tell me things get better just wait and you'll see

Wait and you'll see, wait and you'll see
Wait and you'll see, wait and you'll see
Wait and you'll see

Take one day at a time, everything else you can leave behind
Only one thing at a time, anything more really hurts your mind
I don't want for us to take pills anymore, not that it's bad
I don't want for us to take pills anymore, not that it's bad
I don't want for us to take pills, take pills 'cause we're stronger and, we don't need 'em

Take one day at a time, everything else you can leave behind
Only one thing at a time, anything more really hurts your mind
I don't want for us to take pills anymore, not that it's bad
I don't want for us to take pills anymore, not that it's bad
I don't want for us to take pills, take pills 'cause we're stronger and, we don't need 'em

Take one day at a time, everything else you can leave behind
Only one thing at a time, anything more really hurts your mind
I don't want for us to take pills anymore, not that it's bad
I don't want for us to take pills anymore, not that it's bad
I don't want for us to take pills, take pills 'cause we're stronger and, we don't need 'em
Stronger, and we don't need 'em
Stronger, and we don't need 'em
