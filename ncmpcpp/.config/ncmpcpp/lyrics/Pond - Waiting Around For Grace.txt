Don’t you think I want it too, baby, when I look at you
You’ll miss the golden moment when everything aligned
Did it go on underground without a soul around?
Don’t that make you wonder how God found the time?

We’re always waiting around for grace
To put a smile upon her race
Well, I'm sure she’s got a pretty face than in the world

Well, it’s a real big place, your hands on mine
You know it happens honey all the time
Well, my hands going wild, well it wouldn't be wrong even if I tried
Tired of these goodbyes, of all these weeping eyes
Tired of being tired of the process of being tired, of you being tired of me
I'm tired, tired, tired (tired, tired, tired), tired

We’re always waiting around for grace
To put a smile upon her race
Well, I'm sure she’s got a pretty face in the world

Well, it’s a real big place, your hands on mine, you know

We’re always waiting around for grace
To put a smile upon her race
Well, I'm sure she’s got a pretty face in the world
In the world, in the world, in the world
We’re always waiting around for grace, oh
