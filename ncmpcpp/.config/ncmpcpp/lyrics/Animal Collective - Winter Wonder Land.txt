Mold of the fawn
I have been frozen there for days
With headlights reflecting in my face
I must be cold on your lawn

But inside I'm okay
I can live without your time
Where snowmen never melt
Instead they always shine

And if you don't believe in fantasy then don't believe in fantasy
Do you not believe in fantasy because it gets you down?
If you don't believe it's raining, I won't tell you that it's raining
Do you not believe it's raining just because it gets you down?
And if you don't believe in happiness then don't believe in happiness
If you don't believe in happiness then man you must be down
If you don't believe you're dying, I won't tell you that you're dying
But do you not believe you're dying just because it gets you down?

Our homes are all white
And we go dancing on the lake
And sleds will carry us tonight
And snowflakes will blow us on our way

Drifts rise to the sky
Rainbow hats fly down them
And tears are frozen diamonds
So we smile when we're crying

And if you don't believe in fantasy then don't believe in fantasy
Do you not believe in fantasy because it gets you down?
If you don't believe it's raining, I won't tell you that it's raining
Do you not believe it's raining just because it gets you down?
And if you don't believe in happiness then don't believe in happiness
If you don't believe in happiness then man you must be down
If you don't believe you're dying, I won't tell you that you're dying
But do you not believe you're dying just because it gets you down?
