Wants, you read the soul
To reeve a frost a life stoned
War to raise a bed
The reef is crushing in your head.
I can believe in is frozen
Is the four stone, I have know're she
Want to liver? I have prolen
Just to river? I have the flowing down
Down... Down... Down... A the river...
Wants you're a lead
And will can crew and I sad
Frond, and we are hold
The river frost light all in the road
I can believe in is frozen
Is the four stone, I have know're she
Want to liver? I have prolen
Just to river? I have the flowing down
Down... Down... Down... A the river...
From steal of home
Fourth matches alone stone
Mealt to made in this road
Sick truth the moving flow
I can believe in is frozen
Is the four stone, I have know're she
Want to liver? I have prolen
Just to river? I have the flowing down
Down... Down... Down... A the river...
