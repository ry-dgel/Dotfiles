Feel it come, I don't know
How long it's gonna
Stay with me, oh I'll let
Desire be, desire go

Oh, dare I face the real world?

Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, everyday
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll get out, won't have to

Check my watch, I don't have
The verve to belong to
This dead side, oh why I
Ever tried, I don't know

Oh, dare I face the real world?

Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, everyday
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll forget, try to let desire be, desire go

Feel, feel it come
Feel it come

I feel it come, I don't know
How long it's gonna
Stay with me, oh I'll let
Desire be, desire go
