All I give, are little clues
Maybe one day I’ll get through
But there is nothing I can do
I'll just keep on lying to you

I only need to say it's true
Only heart already knew
But there is nothing you can do
I just keep on lying to you

Should my cover ever blow
Would you ever let it go?
There is something you should know
But hell if I’d ever let it show

So here I am trying to be strong
It was noon, and my shadow was long
I guess I’ll go and tell you just as soon as I
Get to the end of this song

To the end of this song
to the end of this song
To the end of this song
to the end of this song

The curse has won again
Soon I'll be alone
Take all you can
Please understand

That it never really was love
