Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning 
our song shall rise to thee
There is a sign at the sight of theee,
Merciful and mighty
God in three Persons, 
God in three Persons,
Blessed Trinity

Holy, holy, holy!
Though the darkness hide thee,
Though the eye of sinful man 
Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy; 
There is none beside thee,
Perfect in power 
Perfect in power
In love, and purity

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All thy works shall praise thy Name, in 
Earth, and sky, and sea
There is a sign at the sight of theee,
There is none beside thee,
God in three Persons, 
God in three Persons,
God in three Persons,
God in three Persons,
Blessed Trinity
