Venture my way into the dark
Where we can slip one takes one by the hand
Let them crawl into the logs that dam
Brown changed the hue of her pen

Excited and screaming, their voices go wild
And rise with the birds mating up in the pines
Down to puddles that breathe, covered by leaves
With mud they'll make prints on their backs
But how?

Will it be just like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?
Will it be just like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?
But how?

If they're awake till the dawn, well we won't
Fret that they don't have our eye
The ghosts came crowding around and then I
Woke, you slept there on your side

From our window, two lanterns draw signs on the night
And light our two shadows, I watch with delight
Will I want them to be who they will be
Or to be more like their dad
But how?

Will it be just like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?
Will it be just like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?
But how?

When influence is threatened
Maybe I should let them
Maybe we should let them
And I have a question

Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?

Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?

No one should call you a dreamer
No one should call you a dreamer
No one should call you a dreamer
No one should call you a dreamer
