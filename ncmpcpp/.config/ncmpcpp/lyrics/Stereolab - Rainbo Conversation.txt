I yearn for romantic compassion
To love is my sole aspiration
For thee who has love in a million
That has burnt unto consternation

All those who're pig-face and decisive
Glowing for our face and our hearts
Fusing at the sad transformation
That has sadly altered the power

It had to end, became too disappointing
Another end leading a new beginning
I'll try again, the right one will come along
I need someone intoxicating and strong

I yearn for romantic compassion
To love is my sole aspiration
For thee who has love in a million
That has burnt unto consternation

It had to end, became too disappointing
Another end leading a new beginning
I'll try again, the right one will come along
I need someone intoxicating and strong
