Won't you let me?
Well, you know I can drive
Please, let me take your car
Won't you let me take your car?

Two policemen in the car behind
Not on duty but they stopped
And just before the car caught fire
Bravely they pulled her off

Bravely they pulled her off
Bravely they pulled her off
Bravely they pulled her off

If I were you Chrissie I'd rather
If I were you Chrissie I'd rather
If I were you Chrissie I'd rather
If I were you Chrissie I'd rather

If I were you Chrissie I'd rather
If I were you Chrissie I'd rather
If I were you Chrissie I'd rather
If I were you Chrissie I'd rather

Won't you let me?
Well, you know I can drive
Please, let me take your car
Won't you let me take your car?
