Slow drag
I love that new lazy swing
I'm almost (slooow drag)
It sure is dragging me down
I crave that (slooow drag)
It's got my soul on fire
I know that (slooow drag)
It sure is dragging me down
I crave that (slooow drag)

Slow drag
I love that new lazy swing
I'm almost (slooow drag)
It sure is dragging me down
I crave

Slow drag
I love that new lazy
I crave them all
