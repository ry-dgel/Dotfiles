Way away from home
And I don't know what to do
So I grab the telephone
And I call (???)
It rang and rang and rang
It rang again
And then a big big voice said "Uh, hello?"
Stop the ringing calls
Check who's there
I said "Who is you?"
"Well, ah, who is who?"
I've made a big big mess before
"Who is you?"
"Well, ah, who is who?"
Go inside and shut the door
"Get out of my house! Get out of my house! Get out of my house (???)"
Don't let the door hit you
Let the door hit
Yeah that door hit you
Going out of the door
[repeat]
