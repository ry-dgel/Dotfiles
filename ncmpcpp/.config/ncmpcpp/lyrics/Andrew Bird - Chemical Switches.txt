I keep hearing a vicious rumor
From the backrooms, to the aisles, to the avenues
That you lost your sense of humor
And the first place you look is the soles of your shoes

And I watch these ice fields melt into the sea
Warming you're oceans to centuries
Will your saline waters bring you back to me?
All the weight is bringing me to my knees

Chemical switches thrown in the dark
All it takes is a spark to begin
And can you tell which is a one with a mark?
Bleeds through the clothes to the skin

Too long I keep searching the aisles and avenues
But it seems I'm doing it wrong
For I've seen neither hide nor hair of you

And it's a short short walk from pebbles to bricks
From stones back to sticks
We're lowering the boiling point
And as time goes back it's harder to fix
It's a volatile mix, like hydrogen and oxygen

Chemical switches thrown in the dark
All it takes is a spark to begin
