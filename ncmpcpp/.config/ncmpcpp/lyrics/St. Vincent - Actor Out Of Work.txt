You're a supplement, you're a salve
You're a bandage, pull it off
I can quit you, cut it out
You're a patient, iron lung

You're a cast-signed broken arm
You're an actor out of work
You're a liar and that's the truth
You're an extra lost in the scene

Ooh, ooh

You're a boxer in the ring
With brass knuckles underneath
You're the curses through my teeth
You're the laughter, you're the obscene

Ooh, ooh

You're a supplement, you're a salve
You're a bandage, pull it off
I think I love you, I think I'm mad

You're a cast signed broken arm
You're an actor out of work
I think I love you, I think I'm mad

You're a boxer in the ring
With brass knuckles underneath
I think I love you, I think I'm mad
