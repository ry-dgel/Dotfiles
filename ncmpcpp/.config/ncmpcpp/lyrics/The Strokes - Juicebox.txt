Everybody sees me
But it's not that easy
Standing in the light field
Standing in the light field
Waiting for some action
Waiting for some action
Oh, but why won't you come over here?

Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love

Old time grudges
Will die so slowly
I know you miss the
Way I saw you

And cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

Nobody can see me
Everything's too easy
Standing in the light field
Standing in the light field
Waiting for some actress
Waiting for some actress
To say "Why won't you come over here?"

Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love

Old time love song
Will die so swiftly
You never trust me
For a while it was nice
But it's time to say bye

And cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

No, no, no, cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

Oh no, no, no, no, cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

Oh no, you're so cold
