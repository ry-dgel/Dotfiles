Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much 
And I don't give a damn anyway
You always seem to be stepping in shit 
And all you really do is complain  
It's your lie, tell it how you like 
Small minds tend to think alike 

Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much 
And I don't give a fuck anyway  

[Chorus:]
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go [x4]
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go [x2]

Cut the crap 'cause you're screaming in my ear 
And you're taking up all of the space 
You're really testing my patience again
And I'd rather get punched in the face  
You're getting on my every last nerve  
Everything you've said I've already heard 

I'm sick to death of your every last breath 
And I don't give a fuck anyway

[Chorus:]
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go [x4]
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go [x4]

Always fuck fuckin' with my head now..
Always fuck fuckin' with my head now..
Always fuck fuckin' with my head now..
Always fucking with my head and I gotta let it go!

[Chorus:]
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go [x8]
