Auntie Vita in my life.Making tracks for me to find.Relay runnings, never done.

With Auntie Vita in my eyes.

She would find the very song.
She will set my hands on fire.
Hands on fire, overdone.
Her to me and me to him.

And the flames start ???????
I'm on fire.
I'm a sister.
I won't die.

When we were driving in her car.
Friends between her furniture.
And clay clothes.
Singing have you seen her face to her.

I know how this face appeared.
I've seen both sides, I know the drill.
I'll hold the baton.
And the flames start ???????
I'm on fire.
I'm a sister.
I won't die.

And the flames start ???????
I'm on fire.
I'm a sister.
I won't die.

Ah, ooh.
ah, ooh.
ah, ooh.
ah, ooh.
