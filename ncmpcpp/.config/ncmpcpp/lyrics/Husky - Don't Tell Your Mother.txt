Don't tell your mother that we're leaving her
Don't tell your father we may never return
And kiss your little sister while she sleeps
Don't think I'll tell mine, she'll never let us sneak

I'll tell those fuckers that I work for to go to hell
All the people thought they knew me so very well
Josephine, don't love her anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

We'll leave our things behind for friends and family
We'll move like gypsies along shores of silent sea
They'll be no reason to be frightened or sad
They'll be no wishing for the things we never had

You'll tell those fuckers that you work for to go to hell
All the people we thought you knew so very well
Josephine, don't love her anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
