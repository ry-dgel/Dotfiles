Try to tell me how to do it
Only because I'm new to it
Coolness is having courage, courage to do what's right
I'll try to remember always just to have a good time

Try to show me that you know me
Do you know what coolness really is?
Winning is what you want to, winning what you're scared to go for
You try to remember always, always to have a good time

Good time, good time
Good time, good time
Good time, good time
Good time, good time
Good time, good time
Good time

Try and have a softer inside
Shut up boy and be a soldier
Coolness is having courage, courage to do what's right
Try to remember always just to have a good time
Winning is what you want to, winning what you're scared to go for
Try to remember always, always to have a good time

Good time, good time
Good time, good time
Good time, good time
Good time, good time
Good time, good time
