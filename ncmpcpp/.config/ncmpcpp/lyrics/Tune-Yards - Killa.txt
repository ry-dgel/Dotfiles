Advisory - the following lyrics contain explicit language:








Can't you give me something that will keep me whole
I think about the world is right, and even if you can't tonight
Then something that will soothe me
I'm a new kind of woman, I'm a new kind of woman
I'm a don't take shit from you kind of woman so
Buckle up cause we gonna move fast
Traveling through thing that you gotta get past
Buckle up and buckle up tight
Hear a scream, hear a sound in the dark of the night
But right or wrong I'm a new kinda killa
Right or wrong we a, we a killa
Can't you give me something that will keep whole
I think about the world is right, and even if you can't tonight
Then something that will soothe me
I'm a new kind of woman, I'm a new kind of woman
Im a lemon on a black and blue kind of woman so
Pucker up cause I'm gonna come quick
Chicka chicka chicak itll makea you sick
all my violence is here in the sound
Singing aint room for this shit to go down
Ready or not I'm a new kinda killa
Cant you see we a new kinda killa
Can't you give me something that will keep whole
I think about the world is right, and even if you can't tonight
Then something that will soothe me
Would you call me nave and an idealist if I told you I was dishearten that in this day and age I do not have more male black friends? I can not take it, Im so hip. Im hip like a yuppie is hip, confident and yipping at the heels of my yuppie forefathers. I tried to write a song in your style. I tried to steal a.(inaudible talking) IM SO HIP!
I'm a new kind of woman, you're a new kind of man
Come on, come and get me as quick as you can
The danger is coming its coming on strong
Take my hand and we'll both sing along
Can't you give me something that will keep whole
I think about the world is right, and even if you can't tonight
Then something that will soothe me
Watch me now
Im a, Im a
Watch me now
Im a, Im a
Watch me now, Watch me now
Watch me now, Watch me now
