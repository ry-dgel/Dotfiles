I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S
Ring the bell and call or write us
I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S
Can you call the Captain Clitus?

Logan, Grant, and Ronald Reagan (Who will save it?)
In the grave with Xylophagan (Dedicate it?)
Do you know the ghost community? (Who will praise it?)
Sound the horn, address the city (Commemorate it for you)

We are awakened with the axe
Night of the Living Dead at last
They have begun to shake the dirt
Wiping their shoulders from the earth

I know, I know the nations past
I know, I know they rust at last
They tremble with the nervous thought
Of having been, at last, forgot

I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S
Ring the bell and call or write us
I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S
Can you call the Captain Clitus?

B-U-D-A, Caledonia (Who will save it?)
S-E-C-O-R, Magnolia (Dedicate it?)
B-I-R-D-S and Kankakee (Who will praise it?)
Evansville and Parker City (Commemorate it for you)

Speaking their names, they shake the flag
Waking the earth, it lifts and lags
We see a thousand rooms to rest
Helping us taste the bite of death

I know, I know my time has passed
I'm not so young, I'm not so fast
I tremble with the nervous thought
Of having been, at last, forgot

I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S
Ring the bell and call or write us
I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S
Can you call the Captain Clitus?

Comer and Potato Peelers (Who will save it?)
G-R-E-E-N Ridge, Reeders (Dedicate it?)
M-C-V-E-Y and Horace (Who will praise it?)
E-N-O-S, start the chorus (Commemorate it for you)

Corn and farms and tombs in Lemmon (Who will save it?)
Sailor Springs and all things feminine (Dedicate it?)
Centreville and Old Metropolis (Who will praise it?)
Shawneetown, you trade and topple us (Commemorate it for you)

I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S (Who will save it?)
Hold your tongue and don't divide us (Dedicate it?)
I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S (Who will praise it?)
Land of God, you hold and guide us (Commemorate it for you)
