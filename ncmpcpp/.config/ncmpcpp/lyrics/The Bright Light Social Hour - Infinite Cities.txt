Standing without places
Rotation into phases
Neon constellations
Echoing the nameless
Cities without limit
Carpeted and endless
Quilted emigrations
Moonrise in our faces
Stay until we call it home
Distant western gazes
Swollen hearts in vases
Fugitive embraces
Packed away in cases
Comfort is a siren
Radiant and instant
Scattered by the movement
Moonrise in our faces
Stay until we call it home
