You started everything
ou started killing things
ou started severing limbs
        
         
         
vil death roll
 
         
Now

You float and wait for me
Your scales are hard and green
Open your jaw for me

Evil death roll
Now

The night is young - full of sin
Time to slither away again
I can see our history hanging on a knife

So let's start dueling here
I have nothing to hear
I'm grinning ear to ear

Evil death roll
Now
Evil death roll
Now

The night is young - full of sin
Time to slither away again
I can see our history hanging on a knife

So let's start killing things

You distort the notion of the place
The universe's other face
The speed of light has slowed apace
The universe's other face

What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible
Face

Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door

Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door

One, two, three, four!

The night is young - full of sin
Time to slither away again
I can see our history hanging on a knife

So let's start killing things
'Cos you started everything
And let's start severing limbs

Evil death roll
Now
Evil death roll
