What would you say was the matter
When we all laughed at each other
When we all cried together
I was right

If we could all say we're sorry
Give up all awkward tomorrows
Finding nothing more to argue
I was right

Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was right 

Anything you said to me was lost in ether overseas
And timing changes everything when I was right
We discovered one another stumbling through another summer
Worrying we start to wonder, what was right

Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was right 

Anywhere you wanted to be someone else was talking to me
Wave lengths pull magnetically and I was right
And we knew when we tried harder there would be another offer
Knowing, as we're falling under, what was right

Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once was right

Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once was right
