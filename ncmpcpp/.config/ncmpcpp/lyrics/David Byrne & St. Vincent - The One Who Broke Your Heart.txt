All the beautiful people, they did some work on your face
And in that struggle for freedom, everyone looks the same (That's right)
And everybody is pregnant, and everybody's in pain
We're all pushin' and shovin', to make those human beings

Although they say you're aristocracy (That's what they say)
We all deserve to wear that crown

Sing along with the one who broke your heart (You know you do)
Sing aloud, it will keep you safe and warm (That's right)

In the Garden of Eden, on a hot summer day
We were totally naked outside that small caf√©
Am I the one you imagined, am I heaven or hell?
But no one else can compare to the way you love yourself (You know you do)

I came to tell you on this bicycle
The trees and houses say hello

Sing along with the one who broke your heart (You know you do)
Sing aloud, it will keep you safe and warm (That's right)
I dreamed a dream in the middle of the night (I guess I did)
I sing along to open up those teary eyes

Faster and faster, and no one's holdin' the wheel
Interstate highway through those cities and fields
Your friends and family, they tell your secrets to me
S'not so impressive until they all disappear

Sing along with the one who broke your heart (You know you do)
I dreamed a dream, wake up and there you are
