Outside with the cuties
I don't think the woods are too deep
The grass covers the sand
All the wood is damp
Feeling very touched
'Cause my friends are in love.
Feeling pretty far from home now
So I sit to write this down
I guess it's not really brave
I know I'm not a lake.
I haven't written this part yet
Will you help me write it?
You are bug bites on vacation
You find the sad in everything
Can't see you cry
You're down the street
I wonder when you'll talk to me
Your eyes reflect the greenish moon
You move towards me and I love you
I love you
I haven't finished this song yet
Will you help me fix it?
