I wait on the stairs for a break in my mind 
Let the balloons go outside 
Let the balloons go outside 
I wait on the stairs for my thoughts to align 
You are the sun in my mind 
You are the sun in my mind 

Clouds rock like a ship at sea 
Sooth the waves of injury 
Clouds rock like a ship at sea 
Sooth the waves of injury 

I wait on the stairs, there's a view in my mind 
Objects of love in the sky 
Objects of love in the sky 
I wait on the stairs for my thoughts to be kind 
What better view will I find 
What better view will I find 

Inflated with transparency 
Float away my injury 
Inflated with transparency 
Float away my injury 

Let the balloons go outside 
Let the balloons go outside 

I wait on the stairs for a break in my mind 
Let the balloons go outside 
Let the balloons go outside 

Let the balloons go outside...
