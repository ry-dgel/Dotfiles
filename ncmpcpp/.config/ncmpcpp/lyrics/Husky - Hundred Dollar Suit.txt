Into the freeze I make my way
Follow a light unto the nations in my head
Speak not of tomorrow or yesterday
Let us be what we will never be again

On my knees in a hundred dollar suit
All the people came out of their shops
And in their cars the people watched me
Praying in the rain

Shipwrecked hearts start sailing
I wanna see my home again
I wanna see my home again

I still remember every day
Although I thought I'd forgotten everything
The streets in my mind still lead the way
And the people they still smile as they go by

On my knees in a hundred dollar suit
Some think it holy, some just crazy
As the lightening provides glimpses of me
Praying in the rain

Shipwrecked hearts start sailing
I wanna see my home again
Praying in the rain
See the ghosts start sailing

Wild man roams the mountains of my history
Deep sea flourishes with life inside my head
Old love, thought that you had gone away from here

Some think it holy, some just crazy
As the lightening provides glimpses of me
Praying in the rain

Shipwrecked hearts start sailing
I wanna see my home again
Praying in the rain

Shipwrecked hearts start sailing
On my knees in a hundred dollar suit
