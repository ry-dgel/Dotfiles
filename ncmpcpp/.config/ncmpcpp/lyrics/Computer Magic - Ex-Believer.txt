Can you find meIn the darkI haven't got anywhere to go

Can we go back to the start

And the clouds all
Look the same as they did before
Maybe the same day
Oh I'm not going anywhere

I need a reaction
Cause I don't know if I'm here
Can you do the subtraction
All the places that I fear

And I'm running all the time
Can you catch me before I go
And I'm running all the time
Can you catch me before I go
I don't have any other ties
Can you catch me before I go

Are we running
Are we done
Am I going alone
Will you come

And I'm los for
Good and I don't know why
I even came here
I'm done of all these lies

Can you imagine
What it would be like if you were here
I can't imagine
Can you imagine it my dear

And I'm running all the time
Can you catch me before I go
And I'm running all the time
Can you catch me before I go
I don't have any other ties
Can you catch me before I go
