Get back to your seat
Get back mashin' teeth
I want all of your mind

People turn the TV on it looks just like a window, yeah
People turn the TV on it looks just like a window, yeah

Digital witnesses, what's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, you can't see me
What's the point of doing anything?
This is no time for confessing

I'm all in your mind

People turn the TV on it looks just like a window, yeah
People turn the TV on it looks just like a window, yeah

Digital Witness, what's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, you can't see me
Watch me jump right off the London Bridge
This is no time for confessing

People turn the TV on and throw it out the window
Get back to your stare
I care, but I don't care
Oh, I will own your mind
Give me all in your mind
I want all of your mind
Give me all of it

Digital witnesses, what's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, you can't see me?
What's the point of doing anything?
What's the point of even sleeping?
So, I stopped sleeping, I stopped sleeping
Won't somebody sell me back to me?
