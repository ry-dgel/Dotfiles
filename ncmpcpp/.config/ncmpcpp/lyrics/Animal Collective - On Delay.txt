I'll start this off without any words
I got so high I scratched 'till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know that is wrong but what should I do?

I'm on a plain, mmmm
I can't complain, mmmm
I'm on a plain, mmmm

My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know that is wrong but what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
I love myself better than you
I know that is wrong but what should I do?

I'm on a plain, mmmm
I can't complain, mmmm
I'm on a plain, mmmm

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defence I'm neutered and spayed
What the h*** am I trying to say?

It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know that is wrong but what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, and I can go home
I love myself better than you
I know that is wrong but what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain...
