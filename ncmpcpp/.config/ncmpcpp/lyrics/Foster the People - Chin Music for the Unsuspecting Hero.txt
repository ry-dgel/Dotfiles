Today I walked through the door and fell down on my floor
Got all of my papers out and read them
Seems that I've been wanderin' for a little too long
Yeah, the desert can be hot if you're wasted

Took a stab in the dark and missed again, I believe
The hardest part is not seein' what I used to see
My faith grew to a top, but worry does all it can
To whisper in both my ears make-believe stories

Where are my friends now?
They're not around when I need them
I cannot pretend
I find myself against all the odds again

Well, I like to think I'm strong, and then I'm proven wrong
Grab the keys to my car and go to work again
Yeah, showed up late, got screamed in my face
Turn around, I'm punch drunk, but I'm laughin'

Got some thoughts in my chest, they're playin' games with my head
Ten hours of sleep, I'm in my bed again
Scream up to my god, say, "I do what I can"
How am I gonna move on from this circumstance?

Where are my friends now?
They're not around when I need them
I cannot pretend
I find myself against all the odds again

Yeah
Yeah
I'm against all the odds again

Yeah
Yeah
I'm against all the odds again

Yeah
Yeah
I'm against all the odds again

Yeah
Yeah
I'm against all the odds again
