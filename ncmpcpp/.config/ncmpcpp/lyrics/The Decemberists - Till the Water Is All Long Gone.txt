They came down from the mountain
They'd strayed too long from the fountain
And all the while
All the while they longed for us

But I won't betray 
No, I won't betray 
No, I won't betray 
Our water
No, I won't betray
No, I won't betray 
No, I won't betray 
Our water
Till the water's all long gone

And you, my sweet flower
And how you grew more sweet by the hour
And loathe was I
Loathe was I to lose you
My tender rose
My limber rose
My slender loping daughter
My tender rose
My slender rose
My limber loping daughter
But my daughter's long, long gone

They came down from the mountain
They'd strayed too long from the fountain
Oh, my girl
Oh my love, I've lost you

But I won't betray 
No, I won't betray 
No, I won't betray 
Our water
No, I won't betray
No, I won't betray 
No, I won't betray 
Our water
Till the water's all long gone
