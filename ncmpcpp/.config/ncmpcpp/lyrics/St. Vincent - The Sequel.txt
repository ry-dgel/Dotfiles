Oh honey
I was there in the dark where you lay
And I saw you
With a scent on your hands
Going out to get you something

Oh honey
I was there in the dark where you lay
And I saw you
With a scent on your hands
Going out to get you some light

One, two, three flight
Apartment streetside
Bodies like wrecking balls
Fuck, fuck with dynamite
