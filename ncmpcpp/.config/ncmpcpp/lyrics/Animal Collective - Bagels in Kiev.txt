Grandpop, we had sweet days
On the beach in Ventnor, I remember
Wish we could walk along
And you could watch the waves and talk the current Septembers

These days I'm not so sure
Who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn't there when Moses parted the sea
I wasn't there with you, Grandpop, back in Kiev

With the ladies dressed so nice
In their ornate reds and satin textures
Have you since found some peace? 
It's like we can't escape all the noise and violence

These days I'm not so sure
Who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn't there when Moses parted the sea
I wasn't there with you, Grandpop, back in Kiev

Bagels for everyone
That's the kind of thing you would have wanted
There should be lots to eat
Or how can they expect to get a tiring job done?

These days I'm not so sure
Who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn't there when Moses parted the sea
I wasn't there with you, Grandpop, back in Kiev

These days I'm not so sure
Who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn't there when Moses parted the sea
I wasn't there with you, Grandpop, back in Kiev
