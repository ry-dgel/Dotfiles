So they say practice makes you perfect
So they say you can't teach an old dog
So they say have an apple a day
So they say better safe than sorry

Everyone knows what they always say

And when I slow it down
It's clear just how
It's what they don't say
That's what counts

Deep down (what counts)
Step up, step off

So they say practice makes you perfect
So they say you can't teach an old dog
So they say have an apple a day
So they say better safe than sorry

Everyone knows what they always say

And when I slow it down
It's clear just how
It's what they don't say
That's what counts

It's counting
And be sure it counts
