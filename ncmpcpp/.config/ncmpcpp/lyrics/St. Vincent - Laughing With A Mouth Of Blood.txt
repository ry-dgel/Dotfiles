Just like an amnesiac 
Trying to get my senses back 
(Oh, where did they go?)

Laughing with a mouth of blood 
From a little spill I took
(Oh, what are you laughing at?)

See I traded my plot of land 
For a plane to anywhere 
(Oh, where do you go?)

And I can't see the future 
But I know its got big plans for me
(Oh, what does it see?)

All of my old friends aren't so friendly 
All of my old haunts are now all haunting me 

Holed up at the Motel Ritz
With a televangelist
(Oh what did he say?)

At the bottom of a swimming pool
With all the water out of it 
(How'd you get in there?)

I'm sending consolation prizes
To my next of kin, allies
(Oh, they'll be so thrilled)

And I can't see the future 
But I know it's watching me
(Wonder what it sees)

All of my old friends aren't so friendly 
All of my old haunts are now all haunting me

Tell my sister that I miss her
Tell my brother that it gets much easier
Tell my sister that I miss her
Tell my brother that it gets much easier

All of my old friends aren't so friendly
And all of my old haunts are now all haunting me 
All of my old friends aren't so friendly
And all of my old haunts are now all haunting me
