[Hook - Natasha Mosley:]
Early in the mornings when I think about you
Yeah—I hit you like "What you sayin'?"
In the mornings when I wanna fuck you
Yeah—I hit you like "What you sayin'?" I-I-I-I could fuck you all the ti-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ime I-i-i-i-i-i-i-ime, i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ime
I-I-I-I could fuck you all the ti-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ime I-i-i-i-i-i-i-ime, i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ime

M-O-Ë-T, that's the fuck we sippin' (sippin')
That's the fuck we drippin' (drippin'), trap house still tippin'
Facetime when I'm gone, she give me dome from a distance
And she love to climb on top, she love to walk off limpin'
Pimps up, hoes down, legs up or toes down why she jock me?
‘Cause she knocked knees and we got trees, so Mary go around
Gotta know I ate it, she so sweet, now and later
I want that all the time, all the time, I'mma give you all of mine when it's…

[Hook - Lil Wayne (Jeremih)]
Uh, p-p-p-pussy for breakfast, that's how I start my day
My dick is a pen, it's written all over her face
I put my tongue in her mouth, I make them pussy lips drool
She got that junk in her trunk, you know I like junk food
I tell her like this, life is good (good), your pussy better (better)
I put on a magnum (magnum), like a gold medal (medal)
And if it's sweet then I'mma eat it ‘til I get sugar diabetes
I'm a blood and she anemic—we perfect
Tunechi… oh yeah, I make her say... Young mula baby!

Damn, damn lil' mama, you're sticky, icky, icky, got a nigga out here feelin' picky, icky, icky
Every time you put it on, man, it leave me real trippy, every time we on it we keep it 50-50, uh
Don't let the time ticky, icky, icky while I'm snappin' off your bra, and bitin' on your Vickie's
(HEAD, SHOTS) feelin' real tipsy, gettin' real freaky and it's gettin' real frisky
She never say, "no" – damn, she's so, cold
Up and down, that pole – she go, go… (go, go and)
Fuck me like you hate me (yeah), kiss me like you miss me (yeah)
Anything I want to (yeah), that's what she always lets me
