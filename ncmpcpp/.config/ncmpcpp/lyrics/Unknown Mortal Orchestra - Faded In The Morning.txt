Words are floating through the windows and in the house
She blows them away 
faded in the morning time

Haters with their hearts asunder
Will ruin our parade 
faded in the morning time

Walking through the winter markets and all
The horses floated away 
faded in the morning time

Sun is rising, stings my eyes
And don't wanna die today 
faded in the morning time

Words are floating through the windows and in the house
She blows them away 
faded in the morning time

Haters with their hearts asunder
Will ruin our parade 
faded in the morning time

Walking through the winter markets and all
The horses floated away 
faded in the morning time

Sun is rising, stings my eyes
And don't wanna die today 
jaded in the morning time
