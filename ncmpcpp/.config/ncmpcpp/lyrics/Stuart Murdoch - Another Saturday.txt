It's another Saturday, I can't see the calm for chaos
And the worldly body wilting
Under weights that can't be lifted
Looks to you for embrace, looks to you for understanding
Understand the things you're asking
It's a slow and subtle dawning of another Saturday

Be good to the one that's near and bow down to the one that's wanting
When the fearless step comes calling
You'll be ready if you've listened 
To the voice heard in prayer, to a steady invitation
Shut your eyes when you're angry
Bow your head when you get lonely on another Saturday

Look ahead with hope and cheer (Look ahead with hope)
Look ahead with raising spirits
'Cause the one that made us wants us to spread joy amongst the living
And though times may be hard (Times, they may be hard)
And the week behind was painful
He won't ask us to shoulder a weight too much to carry on another Saturday
