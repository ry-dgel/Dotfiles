What the fuck is this world
Running to?

You didn't leave a message
At least I could have
Learned your voice one last time.

Daily minefield
This could be my time
How 'bout you?
Would you hit me?
Would you hit me?

All the bills go by
And initiatives are taken up
By the middle
There ain't gonna be any middle any more

And the cross I'm bearing home
Ain't indicative of my place
Left the porch
Left the porch

Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Walk beside me
I just need to say...

Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Lie beside me
I just need to say
What can I take?
I just want to be
I know that i would not ever touch you
Hold you
Feel you
Ever hold
Never again
