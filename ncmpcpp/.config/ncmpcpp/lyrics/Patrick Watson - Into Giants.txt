Time was running fast
While we were walking so slow
As I watched us grow and grow
We carried our love in cups to go
Grew so tall our heads hit ceilings
Trouble seemed so small
Outgrew all the doors ans walls
We never needed any plans
For ends to meet again
Started as lovers don't know where it's gonna end

Some friends had to disappear
But left a hole for us to grow there in their light
Time keep on passing us by
Into giants you can't stop us
From living out our lives
As we turned into a crowd of smiles
Jumping over all the bad times
For ends to meet again
Started as lovers don't know where it's gonna end
Started as lovers don't know where it's gonna end
Started as lovers don't know where it's gonna end
Started as lovers don't know where it's gonna end
Started as lovers don't know where it's gonna end
