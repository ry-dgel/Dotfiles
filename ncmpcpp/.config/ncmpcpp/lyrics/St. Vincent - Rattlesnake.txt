Follow the power lines back from the road
No one around so I take off my clothes
Am I the only one in the only world?
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Woah oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

I see the snake holes dotted in the sand
As if the Seurat painted the Rio Grande
Am I the only the one in the only world?
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, woah oh, oh oh
Woah oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Woah oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Sweatin', sweatin'
No one is behind me
Sweatin' sweatin'
No one will ever find me

The only sound out here is my own breath
And my feet stuttering to make a path
Am I the only one in the only world?

Is that the wind finally picking up?
Is that a rattle sounding from the brush?
I'm not the only one in the only world
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Woah oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Woah oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Runnin', runnin'
Runnin' rattle behind me
Runnin', runnin'
No one will ever find me
Runnin', runnin'
Runnin' rattle behind me
Runnin', runnin'
No one will ever find me
Sweatin', sweatin'
Sweatin' rattle behind me
Runnin', runnin'
No one will ever find me
Sweatin', sweatin'
Sweatin' rattle behind me
Runnin', runnin'
No one will ever find me
