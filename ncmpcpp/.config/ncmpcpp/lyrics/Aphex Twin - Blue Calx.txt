You were the eyes in the face of fortune
I lost my way and I couldn't find you
Oh, oh no

We're not the first ones to be divided
Won't be the last to be reunited
Oh
Oh no

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's like rain falling down
Drops of pain hit the ground
I can't speak
There's no sound when you're gone
(Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Chorus:]
I can
I will
I know
I can untie these hands
And get back up again
(Oh-ho)
I can
I will
I know
I can untie these hands
And get backup again
I can
Oh
I can
(Get back up again)

I have never lost anything quite like this
No second chances if I don't find it
No (no)
Oh no
(Oh no)

You closed the door and you kept on walking
Left me behind and there's no more talking
No
Oh no
(Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's like rain falling down
Drops of pain hit the ground
I can't speak
There's no sound when you're gone
(Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Chorus:]
I can
I will
I know
I can untie these hands
And get backup again
(Oh-ho)
I can
I will
I know
I can untie these hands
And get back up again
I can
Oh
I can
(Get back up again)

We're not the first ones to be divided, oh
Won't be the last to be reunited, no
(Come on, one more time)
When you're gone

[Chorus:]
(Come on)
I can
I will
I know
I can untie these hands
And get back up again
(Oh-ho)
I can
I will
I know
I can untie these hands
And get back up again
I can
Oh
I can
(Get back up again)
