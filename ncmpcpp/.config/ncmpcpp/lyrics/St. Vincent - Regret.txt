Morning pry the windows open
Let in what's so terrifying
Summer is as faded as a lone cicada call
Memories so bright I gotta squint just to recall
Regret the words I've bitten more than the ones
I ever said

Who is the one animal all by yourself all of us
All of us

Who is the one animal all by yourself all of us
All of us

I'm afraid of heaven because I can't stand the heights
I'm afraid of you because I can't be left behind

Oh well there's a red moon rising
The door slammed and it felt like a cannonball

Who is the one animal all by yourself all of us
All of us
Who is the one animal all by yourself all of us all of us
All of us all of us
