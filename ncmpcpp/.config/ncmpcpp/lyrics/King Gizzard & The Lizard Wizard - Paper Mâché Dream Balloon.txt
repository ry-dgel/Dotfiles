Stuck in a daydream under a moonbeamHead on my pillow at homeDrunk are the people outside my window

Full of testosterone

When I get trouble my way
Like paper mâché
They stick to my dream balloon
And I kick it out my door

Paper Mâché
Dream Balloon

Are you all-knowing that I am brewing
Moping around on my own
Stuck in a daydream under a moonbeam
Head on my pillow at home

When I get trouble my way
Like paper mâché
They stick to my dream balloon
And I hide it in my drawer

Paper Mâché
Dream Balloon
Paper Mâché
Dream Balloon

When I get trouble my way
Like paper mâché
I stick them to a dream balloon
And I kick it out my door
And I hide it in my drawer
