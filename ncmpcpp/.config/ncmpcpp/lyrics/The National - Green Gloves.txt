Falling out of touch with all, my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them

Take another sip of them, it
Floats around and takes me over
Like a little drop of ink in a
Glass of water

Get inside their clothes
With my green gloves
Watch their videos
In their chairs
Get inside their beds
With my green gloves
Get inside their heads
Love their loves

Cinderella through the room, I
Glide and swan 'cause I'm the
Best slow dancer in the
Universe

Falling out of touch with all, my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them

Get inside their clothes
With my green gloves
Watch their videos
In their chairs
Get inside their beds
With my green gloves
Get inside their heads
Love their loves

Now I hardly know them
And I'll take my time
I'll carry them over
And I'll make them mine

Get inside their clothes
With my green gloves
Watch their videos
In their chairs
Get inside their beds
With my green gloves
Get inside their heads
Love their loves
