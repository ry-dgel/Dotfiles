Tell her that you love her, if you really love her
But when your heart just ain't sure, let her know

Growing by the hour, love just like a flower
But when the flower dies, you've got to say goodbye
And let her go

Let her go
Let her go

Tell her that you'll be there, if you'll really be there
Separation's supposed to make the heart grow fond
But it don't

So tell her that you love her, if you really love her
But when your heart just ain't sure, let her go

Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
