I found the fragrance separate from the flower
In all the logic I was lost
I found the fair light blossom to be sour
And beneath the soil the real cost

You can to me carelessly, I am iris and the lense
The bridge adjusting to the water, water, water, water
The level inside will rise, a fallen monument lies

A prism is only walls
My arms will not be bars
The well now is your support
In autosuggested pathways you are caught

You can to me carelessly, I am iris and the lense
The bridge adjusting to the water, water, water, water
The level inside will rise, a fallen monument lies
