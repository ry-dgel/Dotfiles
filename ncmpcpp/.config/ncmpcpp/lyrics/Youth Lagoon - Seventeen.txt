Roaming the campground up by the lake where we swam
We were hunting for snakes
But we couldn't find them
Surrounded by nothing
But the nothing's surrounded by us
But it's just me in my room
With my eyes shut

Oh, when I was seventeen
My mother said to me
"Don't stop imagining. The day that you do is the day that you die"
Now I pull a one-ton carriage
Instead of the horses, grazing along
I was having fun
We were all having fun

My brain can think faster than I can
But not fast enough
Who is there to talk to
That won't lock me up?
At least God doesn't judge me by the thoughts that aren't mine
The snakes I couldn't find
I don't want to find

Oh, when I was seventeen
My mother said to me
"Don't stop imagining. The day that you do is the day that you die"
Now I pull a one-ton carriage
Instead of the horses, grazing along
I was having fun
We were all having fun

When I was seventeen
My mother said to me
"Don't stop imagining. The day that you do is the day that you die"
Now I pull a one-ton carriage
Instead of the horses, grazing along
I was having fun
We were all having fun
