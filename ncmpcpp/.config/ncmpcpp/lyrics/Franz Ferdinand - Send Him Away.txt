I can't seem to feel the envy I should feel 
Or maybe 
I don't need the sour side of love 
Of love 

No, I don't care his breath is in your hair 
Well, I don't care his skin is still between 
Still on fold of your sheets 
Send him away 

I don't mean to claim or own you 
Or maybe I would like to 
But I need whatever side of love 
Is there 

No, I don't care his breath is in your hair 
Well, I don't care his skin is still between 
Still on fold of your sheets 
Send him away 

Oh, can't you let me stay tonight? 
Oh, can't you let me stay tonight? 
Oh, can't you let me stay tonight? 
Can't you let me stay tonight?
