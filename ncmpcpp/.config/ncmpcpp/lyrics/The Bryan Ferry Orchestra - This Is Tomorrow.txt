Here in the hush of evenin'
On a night in June
Overhearin' conversations
Bayin' at the moon
Suddenly a voice I'm hearing
Sweet to my ear
This is tomorrow's callin'
Wishin' you were here
Layin' in my motel bedroom
Feelin' ceilin' blues
Wall to wall a TV's twitchin'
Clearly not a muse
Then flashin' through the interference
Beams a thousand tunes
This is tomorrow callin'
What have I to lose?
Truckin' by the railway station
I'm on the road again
Steerin' clear of all termination
Unto the point of pain
When steamin' through on cue
I hear that wailin' whistle blow
If this is tomorrow callin'
Oh, what a way to go
Day to day you live old fashioned
Hi-toned, fancy free
A double take, an image-spittin'
Tailored to a T
While history is tellin' you
The same old thing
This is tomorrow callin'
Let's stick a new oar in
This is tomorrow callin'
Y'all an' come on in
