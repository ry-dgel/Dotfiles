Young red bird, they're just natural feelings
I can't keep from changing my brains
Bending my wants with my rights
Are my friends still half right?
Should I keep them separate from me?
It's unclear then I get a cold
Can I get a light? It's a certain type of easy pace
That's what we need to make it

Come in close, I trust you
Your nose dipped in my sweat
It dripped on your beautiful sweater
Kind of nice, should I really lie with you?
I never know when I'm on my own
Are there more important things to do
Than kiss or sleep? Today we gotta wake up

Then I talk to your breath and we enjoy the air
And I creep on your chest to the hut I have
Where I pluck a few notes on the strands of your hair
And I'm singing to you what to do if I'd ask you to make funny faces
With me in the mirror of the bathroom

Know you're next, you make me feel alright
Are you just like me? Never gonna pick one kind of fruit
Like a mushed banana on your tooth
And you like the sting of the cherry juice
Never eat an apple, that's just one color

Young red bird, they're just natural feelings
Like walking off to ride my bike or just bump into you
I haven't seen you in a week or three days
Though it really bugs me, it's nice to find new ways to smile
I keep thinking that when you feel sad, you can't pout
'Cause what this song's about is me singing
I'm just wondering what to do with you myself and me
Naked in the mirror of the bathroom
