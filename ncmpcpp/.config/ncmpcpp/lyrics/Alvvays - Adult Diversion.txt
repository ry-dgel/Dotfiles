How do I get close to you
Even if you don't notice
As I admire you on the subway
When it's dark outside your house
You won't let anybody out
And keep a padlock on your door
One more cocktail
And I'm on your trail
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly
How do I grow old with you
Even if you don't notice
As I pass by you on the sidewalk
When it's dark outside your house
You won't let anybody out
You're keeping a dead girl in the closet
One more cocktail
Is it a good time
Or is it highly inappropriate
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And then go back to university
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly
I won't waste a moment (x3)
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And then go back to university
