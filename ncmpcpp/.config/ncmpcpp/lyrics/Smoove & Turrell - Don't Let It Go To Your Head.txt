So what if I came clean, and told you all you mean to me, so what if I meant every word I said,
baby don't let it go to your head 
So what if I write your name, cause you're always on my brain, in a heart I paint in crimson red,
baby dont let it go to your head 
Dont be getting any big ideas, let me make it clear 

Just cause I cant go on, just cause I die when ur gone, and just cause I think of you in bed,
dont let it go to your head, if I dim your eyes, one too, too many times, analyse every word you said,
dont let it go to your head, oh oh, don't let it go to your head, oh oh 

So what if I want to kiss, from your toes up to your lips, it don't mean that you have me yet,
youre gonna be good out of bed, I'm the one who's in control here, let me make it clear 

Just cause I cant go on, just cause I die when ur gone, just cause I think of you in bed,
dont let it go to your head, if I dim your eyes, one too, too many times, analyse,
every word you said, dont let it go to your head, dont let it go to your head, oh oh 

Now you think you got me 
Well im gonna get you 
Now you think you can touch me 
Well im gonna let you 

Just cause I cant go on, just cause I die when ur gone, just cause I think of you in bed, dont let it go to ur head 
Just cause I cant go on 
Just cause I die when ur gone 
Just cause I think of you in bed, dont let it go to your head, if I dim your eyes, one too,
too many times, analyse every word you said, dont let it go to your head, dont let it go to your head,
dont let it go your head, dont let it go to your head, dont let it go to your head...
