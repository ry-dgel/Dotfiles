Get just what you need
Just what
Want more than you need
Want more
Dread follows that lead
Follow the lead

Near as far from the ship that sleep, oh
(Come on)

More than you can see
See more
Seeds become a tree
Because you can't
Be a growth
And the same as before
(Come on)

Get just what you need
Just what
Want more than you need
Follow the lead

Near as far from the balm as the cut
