Laura is learning how to love, see, can't you see
It hurts to see her go to parties all alone

And I hope to bring back Elvis and get all the stars of the past
Together at last for a cover show and we can make it last on the flaming star

(?) and the world is left to never let you run
To do right 'em all except what can (?) be
Light up and colour-code your old LPs
The never turn a more, it's just a garage rock that rattles to the floor
Every morning separating, you and Caroline again

The look in your eyes, it looks just like the twilight of your life
Now your stone cold tired and your wife is getting high with your daughter
And another guy in the starlight

And I hope to bring back Elvis and get all the stars of the past
Together at last for a cover show
And we can make it last on the flaming star
