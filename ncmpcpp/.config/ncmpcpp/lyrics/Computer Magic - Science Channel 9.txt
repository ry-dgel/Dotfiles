Electronic fencesKeeping me insideI never learn my lessons         
         
         They always make me tired  
         
Staying up all night and
Thinking of just how
Awkward I've become
I only need you now

Electronic fences
Keeping me inside
I sometimes get restless
But usually it subsides

Do you think that someday
You'll come rescue me
I'll remember your face
Will you remember me

My feelings condense and
I just tend to lie
Always thinking 'bout you
Won't tell you 'couse I'm shy

Am I really too young
Or am I not your type
Stuck inside a prison
You're my entire life
