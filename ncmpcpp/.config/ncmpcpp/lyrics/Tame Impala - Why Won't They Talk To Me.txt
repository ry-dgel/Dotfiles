Out of this zone
Trying to see
I'm so alone
Nothing for me
I guess I'll go home
Try to be sane
Try to pretend
None of it happened
Oh, this old tree
Lonely old me
Whoops-a-daisy
I thought I was happy

Out of this zone
Now that I see
I don't need them
And they don't need me
I guess I'll go home
Try to be sane
Try to pretend
None of it happened
Destined to be
Lonely old me
Whoops-a-daisy
I thought I was happy

Ah, why won’t they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won’t they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won’t they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won’t they talk to me? (Aah, aah)
Ah, why won’t they talk to me?

But I don't really care about it anyway
I wouldn't listen to a word any others say
They just talk about themselves all day 
One day I'll be a star and they'll be sorry

Ah, why won’t they talk to me?
Ah, why won’t they talk to me?
Ah, why won’t they talk to me?
Ah, why won’t they talk to me? (Aah, aah)
Ah, why won’t they talk to me?
