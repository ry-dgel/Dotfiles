Deep blue sea, darling
On a deep blue sea
Deep blue sea, darling
On a deep blue sea

And it was mama that got drowned in 
Out in that deep blue sea

Dig his grave, darling 
With a silver spade
Dig his grave, darling 
With a silver spade

And it was brother that got drowned in 
Out in that deep blue sea

Drop him down, darling
With a golden chain
Drop him down, darling
With a golden chain

And it was daddy that got drowned in 
Out in that deep blue sea
