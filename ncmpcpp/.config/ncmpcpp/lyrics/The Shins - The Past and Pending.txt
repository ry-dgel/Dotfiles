As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn
We settle down to cut ourselves apart
Cough and twitch from the news on your face
And some foreign candle burning in your eyes

Held to the past, too aware of the pending
Chill as the dawn breaks and finds us up for sale
Enter the fog, another low road descending
Away from the cold lust, your house, and summertime

Blind to the last cursed affair
Pistols and countless lies
A trail of white blood betrays
The reckless route your craft is running

Feed 'til the sun turns into wood
Dousing an ancient torch
Loiter the whole day through
And lose yourself in lines dissecting love

Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay
Offer me little but doting on a crime
We've turned every stone and for all our inventions
In matters of love lost, we've no recourse at all

Blind to the last cursed affair
Pistols and countless lies
A trail of white blood betrays
The reckless route your craft is running

Feed 'til the sun turns into wood
Dousing an ancient torch
Loiter the whole day through
And lose yourself in lines dissecting love
