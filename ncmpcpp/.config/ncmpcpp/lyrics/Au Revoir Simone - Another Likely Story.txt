Don't tell me
It's another likely story
Could've pinned it on you from the start
Well I'm new here
Doesn't mean I have to answer
Silly questions or a shot in the dark

You know I'm a child
I keep this alive

It gets harder
I remember to remember
Waking up again all over again
If there's an echo
Repeat days I'd likely let go
And be the changes we are noticing

When we're running wild
We keep this alive

Still I wonder
Sights around us fade and underneath
The ground shakes, things fall apart
And no other than the voice of one another
Keeps us safely moving on in the dark

You know I'm a child
I keep this alive
