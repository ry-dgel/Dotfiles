You remind me of you
The way you shot right through and how

You broke my window glass,
Fast, it happened so fast
I have to confess that I
That I was impressed that I
That I was impressed that I

Despite all the mess and the broken glass
I was impressed

Here's where I disappeared
Where I fell off the pier
And to be rescued I did wait
I watched waterbugs skate
As they draw figure eights as they draw
From the bottom of the lake as they draw
I watched waterbugs skate as they draw
From the bottom of the lake I watched waterbugs skate

Memories, like mohair sweaters,
Stretched and pilled faux distressed letters
Moose's horns and figure eights
White plastic bags in search of mates
What suffocates the land
In the memory of a garbage can
Memory of a garbage can

But you, you can't be found when the bell rings
You weren't there that day for the naming of things

The naming of things
The naming of things

Where the homeroom bell rings
The homeroom bell

Hey, just look at the mess you made today
Didn't really think it would get this bad
Hey, feel like you're living in a Russian play
Where it seems like you made everybody mad

You remind me of you
When you shot through
And broke my window glass
It happened so fast
I have to confess
I was impressed, I was impressed
despite all the mess and the broken glass
I was impressed
