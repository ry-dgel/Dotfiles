I've been watching you
Not waiting for the right moment to make the first move
Do you want to know
Why I keep avoiding your eyes
And why I'm running away?
It's crazy, I know
I've been conceiving you for too long
Or maybe I'm destined to be alone
Or maybe there's someone who will understand
That I'm not able to share my world
I'm still running away
It's crazy, I know
I've been conceiving you for too long
If only I could change all things around
Still conceiving you all along...
I've been conceiving you for too long
If only I could change all things around
I've been conceiving you for too long
I've grown used to that
Still conceiving you all along...
