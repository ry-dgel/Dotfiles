Shifting, shifting, shifting aloud like it makes so much difference to me
Huffing, puffing, marching around like I know how much better it should be
I know it looks like I disagree, nine tenths of the time

But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind

Childhood puppy is old and gruff, your mother wants to give him away
Pillar of strength was lifted off his deathbed, 3 weeks ago today

But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind

But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't really mind...
