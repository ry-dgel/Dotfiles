There isn't much that I feel I need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
I only want a proper house
There isn't much that I feel I need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

There isn't much that I feel I need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
I only want a proper house
There isn't much that I feel I need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the freshest wave
But to provide for mine who ask
I will with heart on my father's grave
I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the freshest wave
But to provide for mine who ask
I will with heart on my father's grave

On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls
I don't mean to seem like I care about material things like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls

There isn't much that I feel I'd need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the freshest wave
But to provide for mine who ask
I will with heart on my father's grave

On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls
I don't mean to seem like I care about material things like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls
I don't mean to seem like I care about material things like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls
I don't mean to seem like I care about material things like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls
