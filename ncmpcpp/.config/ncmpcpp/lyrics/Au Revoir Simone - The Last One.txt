Before you ask me again
You better think it over
Is this what you wanted in life
I'm the last one

I know you think that you know me
'Cause it's been a long time
I don't ask any questions
When you tell me that I’m the last one

I'm the one to forget
The one you won't regret
I'm the one to forget
The one you won't regret

So let me, let me go
'Cause you don't
And you'll never know

If you can't tell the real from the imaginary
It will seem surprising when i disappear
Like the last one

I'm the one to forget
The one you won't regret
I'm the one to forget
The one you won't regret

So let me, let me go
'Cause you don't
And you'll never know

So let me, let me go
'Cause you don't
And you'll never know
