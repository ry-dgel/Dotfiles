Summer, summer
Summer, summer

Sweet summer night and I'm stripped to my sheets
Forehead is leaking, my AC squeaks
And a voice from the clock says, "You're not gonna get tired"
My bed is a pool and the wall's on fire
Soakin' my head in the sink for awhile
Chills on my neck and it makes me smile but
My bones have to move and my skin's gotta breathe
You pick up the phone and I'm so relieved

You slide down your stairs to the heated street
And the sun has left us with slippery feet
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
And be here with you, we're going

I'm not sure where
I'm not sure where, but I have seen you today

It doesn't really matter, I'll go where you feel
Hunt for the breeze, get a midnight meal
I point in the windows, you point out the parks
Rip off your sleeves and I'll ditch my socks
We'll dance to the songs from the cars as they pass
Weave through the cardboard, smell that trash
Walking around in our summertime clothes
Nowhere to go when our bodies glow

And we'll greet the dawn in its morning blues
With purple yarn, you'll be sleeping soon
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you

When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
When the sun goes down, we'll go out again
Don't cool off, I like your warmth

Let's leave the sound of the heat for the sound of the rain
It's easy to sleep when it whets my brain
It covers my rest with a saccharine sheen
Kissing the wind through my window screen
The restlessness calls, says that I cannot hide
So much on my mind that it spills outside
Do you want to go stroll down the financial street?
Our clothes might get soaked, but the buildings sleep

And there's no one pushing for a place
Let's meander at an easy pace
And I want to walk around with you
And I want to walk around with you
I want to walk around with you
I want to walk around with you
I want to walk around with you
I want to walk around with you

Just you, just you, just you, just you
Just you, just you, just you, just you
Just you, just you, just you, just you
Just you, just you, just you, just you
