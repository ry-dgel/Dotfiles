Feelings
Flashcards
Fake knife
Real ketchup
Cardboard
Cutthroats
Cowboys of information

Pleasure dot loathing dot Huey dot Newton
It was a lonely lonely winter

Fuckless porn sharks
Toothless but got a big bark
Live children blind psychics
Turned online assassins

So Hale-Bopp, Hail Mary, Hail Hagia Sophia
Ooh, it was a lonely lonely winter

Entombed in the shrine
Of zeros and ones, you know
You know
Oh we fatherless features, you motherless creatures, you know

Oh, perpetual lying, always terribly frightening, you know
You know
You got the pop in the hiss
In the city of misfits, you know

Safe, safe, and safest
Faith for the faithless
Oh, dim, dim and dimmer
Sucker for sinners

I'm entombed in the shrine
Of zeros and ones, you know
You know
Oh we fatherless features, you motherless creatures, you know
Hey
Oh, perpetual lying, always terribly frightening, you know
You know
You got the pop in the hiss
In the city of misfits
Oh, safe, safe, and safest
Faith for the faithless
