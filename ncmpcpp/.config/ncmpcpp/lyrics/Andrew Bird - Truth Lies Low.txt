Here's a little game
You can play along
Oh you do the walk of shame
From the comfort of your home
So here's another game
You can play along
Where you empty all your blame
From your guilty bones

Oh the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, they know
The eyes they know
Like a thousand tiny suns that glow
Oh the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, they know
While truth lies low
While truth lies low

So here's another game...

Fools that take a name [?]
Got pistols in their phones
[?] she is on the way
Got plastic in our stones

Oh the lies, the lies, the lies, they grow
Like a thousand tributaries flow
Oh the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, they know
While truth lies low
While truth lies low

Vitriol from their pens flows
Anonymously their hate grows
But at they care enough
At they care enough
At they care enough
To let you know
