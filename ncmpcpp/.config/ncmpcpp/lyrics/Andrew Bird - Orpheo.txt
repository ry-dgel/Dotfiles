And there are places we must go to
To bring these hollow words on back from
You must cross a muddy river
Where love turns to love turns to fear
They say you don't look
There's only one way
On back from on back from here
They say you don't look
They say you don't look cause it'll disappear

And our eyes they keep on strainin'
As if to see what lies behind them
Through the shells of empty buildings and great columns of glass
They say you don't look
They say you don't look
Cause it'll drive you mad
And if it drives you mad
If it drives you mad
It'll prob'ly pass
