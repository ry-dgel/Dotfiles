("Well if youâ€™re out and about on the freeways this morning, no dinosaurs to worry about")

So many ways to wait beyond the lines that border us from them
Don't take a shot, a smoke to trigger just a little bit from them

Can't be a crime to meddle
Can't be wrong to push the pedal
Queasy and grime, no balance
Standing bones don't up the level

So many times, the prints don't match the brush that painted it [from them]
Don't take a forge, or wait to dazzle as a conjurer [from them]

Behind the drape, un-aging
Behind aims of rearrangements
Stuck in the slime, no paddle
Guarded life, don't tend to dabble

Legalize this principle
Jump into our spot, not physical
Bring it closer to the middle, want to write with control
[one step a] [what's left but]

Wander from the cynical
Take a look at this atypical
With an amplitude for rhythm
As a tightening will, just when it starts to let go

Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus

Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus

So many ways
Can't be a crime
Behind the drape

Wander from the cynical
Take a look at this atypical
With an answer to the riddle
As the tightening grip, just when it starts to let go

Jump into a spot not physical
Bring it closer to the middle
Want to write with control
A slipping grip has let go

Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus

Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus
Hocus pocus
