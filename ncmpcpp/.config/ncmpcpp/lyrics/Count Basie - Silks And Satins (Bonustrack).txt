Those silk shiny stockings
That I wear when I'm with you
I wear 'cause you told me
That you dig that crazy hue
Do we feel the romance
When we go to the dance
Oh no, you take a glance
At those shiny stockings
Then came along some chick
With great big stockings, too
When you changed your mind about me
Why, I never knew
I guess I'll have to find
A new, a new kind
A guy who digs my shiny stockings, too
Then came along some chick
With great big stockings, too
When you changed your mind about me
Why, I never knew
I guess I'll have to find
A new, a new kind
A guy who digs my shiny stockings, too
A new guy who digs my shiny stockings, too
