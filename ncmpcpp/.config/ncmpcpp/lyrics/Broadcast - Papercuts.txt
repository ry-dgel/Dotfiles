You can't pretend cause I can see
You're not the boy you used to be
Trust me with a secret you can't keep
I watch your eyes they shift with doubt
So every night when stars come out
I try to read your personality

The writing for pleasure you wouldn't let me read
The things you miss out when you try to mislead
You said you wrote a page about me in your diary

Your heart a place that noone sees
You can't disguise your own unease
Trust me with a secret you can't keep

The writing for pleasure you wouldn't let me read
The things you miss out when you try to mislead
You said you wrote a page about me in your diary
Don't be so afraid, there's bound to be a place
No matter who or where you are, you've got to be willing
You've got to be willing
The writing for pleasure you wouldn't let me read
The things you miss out when you try to mislead
You said you wrote a page about me in your diary
Don't be so afraid, you're bound to make mistakes
No matter who or where you are, you've got to be willing
Don't be so afraid, there's bound to be a place
No matter who or where you are, you've got to be willing
You've got to be willing
