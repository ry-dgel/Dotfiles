This my excavation and today is Kumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain
This is paralyzed

I keep throwing it down two-hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell

On your back with your racks and the stacks as your load
In the back and the racks of the stacks are your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

Well I've been twisting to the sun I needed to replace
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down in a frozen ground

There's a black crow sitting across from me; his wiry legs are crossed
And he's dangling my keys he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss?

On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

This is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be
Safe with me
