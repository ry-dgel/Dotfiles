Oh lady fair, your stranglin' hair ribbons 'round my tongue.
 try to speak [but] my thoughts grow weak from all the yarns you've spun.
 heard them say that evil may walk in beauties' shoes.
         
           
well if ever i could love myself
then i'll stop loving you.

were you out the other night flirting with all my friends?
i heard you told a joke or two with my name at the end.
come 'round home, i'm all alone, and tell me that just ain't true.

well if ever i could love myself
then i'll stop loving you.

when you're gone, i'll carry on, it's never meant to last.
i'd much prefer to sit alone and dream about the past.
so i say "some how, some way" till i believe it's true.

and if ever i could love myself
then i'll stop loving you
