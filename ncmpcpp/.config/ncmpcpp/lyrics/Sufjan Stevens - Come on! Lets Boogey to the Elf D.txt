Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

Tie up your boots
Jump off the ladder
Pack up your clothes
Nothing's the matter
Mistletoe hangs up in the bedroom
Your sister's bangs
She cut them herself
Santa is here
Sleighbells are ringing
Twenty-one elves
They are all singing
K-Mart is closed
So is the bakery
Everyone's home watching TV

Santa Claus is coming
Hear the banjo strumming

Chestnuts and fire, holly and hay
Jesus and Mary, what a great day
Evergreen tree, covered in snow
Tower of Babel, tower of glow
There's Aunt Marie, hand on the fire
They give us good gifts
Like mittens and socks
Hijack a snow plow
Clear out the streets
Tell all of the neighbors
There's cookies to eat

Get up off the floor and give a shout
There's a lot to shout about
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's got the greatest gifts around
Away in a manger no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked downward where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay
