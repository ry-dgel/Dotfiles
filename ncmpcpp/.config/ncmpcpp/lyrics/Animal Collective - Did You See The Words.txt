Have you seen them? The words cut open
Your poor intestines can't deny
When the inky periods drip from your mailbox and
Blood flies, dip and glide, reach down inside
Grab inside
There's something living in these lines

And when your newest kisser is peeking
You dress yourself up tonight
Get all tangled up in arms and legs, it's cramped up and
Someone grabs a hold, do you go oh oh oh?
Should you go home?
There's something starting, don't know why

And in a house so cozy
Few words are spoken
Let's take our shoes off and unwind
When there's minuets off in the background drowning out
Eyes off, ears off, test the kiss good night
A kiss good night
Don't keep my loving on my mind

Because it's messy, yes, this mess is mine
Though mine is messy, yours is maybe nine

Look we've had similar stitches
Look we have similar frowns
Do the elderly couples still kiss and hug and
Grab their big wrinkly skin, so tough, wrinkly wrink, wrink wrinkly rough?

Did you see the words you know?
Give me rabies, hand me babies at the hospital
Violent ends with friends that go
I kissed a few in sticky shoes, our cartoon show is broken
Did you see the words you know?
Give me rabies, hand me babies at the hospital
Violent ends with friends that go
I kissed a few in sticky shoes, our cartoon show is broken
