To those who hate have cried for no one
You can call, you can call
To those who talk and wish against me
You can call, you can call

Late in the evening when it gets dark you can call

To those who say they go unbeaten
You can fall, you can fall
To those who say it's because they're weak
You can fall, you can fall

Late in the evening when it gets dark you can fall

You can call, you can call
You can call, you can call
