I just wanted
To resolve it
To make peace with
All those weekends

We all just give up
We all stand down
With no lesson learned
With our eyes half shut

No confusion
It's been obvious
Hallelujah
I've been saved by no one again, and again

But we all just give up
We all stand down
With no lesson learned
With our eyes half shut
