You ain't too certain
Your heart can spark a flame again
Prepare yourself
Repair yourself

You waste all your memories
Your love, your luck
Your beauty sleep

Building all those barriers
Don't you know they never work?
Building all those barriers
To try to keep away the hurt

And I never believed that your heart was ever missing
Even though the alibi that you had was so goddamn convincing

You ain't too certain
Your heart can spark a flame again
Prepare yourself
Repair yourself

You waste all your energy
Your love, your luck
Your beauty sleep

Building all those barriers
To try to keep away the hurt
Building all those barriers
Don't you know they never work?

And I never believed that your heart was ever missing
Even though the alibi that you had was so goddamn convincing

Hit in the head with a giant rolling pin
Sometimes the pain will help you remember when
Your heart was young before it got stepped on
Inside you'll feel a ticking timebomb just
(Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick)
Ticking

Hit in the head with a giant rolling pin
Sometimes the pain will help you remember when
Hit in the head with a giant rolling pin
Your heart was young before it got stepped on
Inside you'll feel a ticking timebomb just
(Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick)
Ticking

Repair yourself
Repair yourself
Repair yourself
Repair yourself
Again
