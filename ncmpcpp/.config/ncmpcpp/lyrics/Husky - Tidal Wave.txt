I climbed aboard a tidal wave
Bearing down upon the city from the ocean
They said it would come any day
Like a monster of perpetual devotion

I was surfing it clear
I was crashing through the city streets
Where we once went looking for love

I'd change my name if I had one to change
I'd change the world if I wasn't so plain
I see your eyes in my eyes suddenly

I was driving through the open plains
When I came upon a white horse grazing
There was nothing around but him and me
And the lights up in the night sky blazing

I was riding him clear
We went riding through the same old streets
Where I once went looking for love

I'd change my name if I had one to change
I'd change the world if I wasn't so plain
I see your eyes in my eyes suddenly

I climbed aboard a tidal wave
Bearing down upon the city from the ocean
They said it would come any day
Like a monster of perpetual devotion

I was surfing it clear
Crashing through the city streets
Where I once went looking for love
