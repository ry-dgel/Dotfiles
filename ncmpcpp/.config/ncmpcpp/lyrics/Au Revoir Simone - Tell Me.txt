Places exist
Just when we need them
And times like this
Just when we need them
I never noticed before
Seems that I was waiting for
If we ignore all the signs
Doesn't mean there won't be more
Things are far out
Electric is the air
And farther out
There's magic everywhere
If we can see
Everything that we could be noticing
And really see we can wake
From the scenes we're all dreaming
