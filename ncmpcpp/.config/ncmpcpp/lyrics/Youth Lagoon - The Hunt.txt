As the foxes hunt
All the chickens start to run
Next thing I know
My neck no longer has a front

All the wars are me
I won't sleep until my grave
I am young but I am brave
And I am not your slave

I will swear to you now that I'm not what they say
I have a sickness in my head that won't go away
And by the time the bugs eat their way out of my skull
Will you still say I love you?
Will you still want my soul?

As the lions hunt
All the zebras start to run
They all refuse to become
Someone else's lunch

'Cause all the wars are me
I won't sleep until my grave
I am young but I am brave
And I am not your slave

I will swear to you now that I'm not what they say
I have a sickness in my head that won't go away
And by the time the bugs eat their way out of my skull
Will you still say I love you?
Will you still want my soul?
