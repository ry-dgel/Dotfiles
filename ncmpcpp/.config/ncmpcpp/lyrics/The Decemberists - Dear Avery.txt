Dear Avery
I think of you only
Were you waving
Were you dead on the vine?

Oh Avery
To think of you lonely
Would I could just grab you
By the nape of your neck

There are times life will rattle your bones
And will bend your limbs
But you’re still far and away the boy you’ve ever been
So you bend back and shake at the frame
Of the frame you made
(But don’t you shake alone)
Please, Avery, come home

Head strong
You and your long arms
Listing lazily
On the cusp of your teens

But you were my Avery
And when you needed saving
I could just grab you
By the nape of your neck

There are times life will rattle your bones
And will bend your limbs
But you’re still far and away the boy you’ve ever been
So you bend back and shake at the frame
Of the frame you made
(But don’t you shake alone)
Please, Avery, come home
