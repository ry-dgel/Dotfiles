Oh, woman, tell me what you want and I'll calm down without bleeding out
With a broken heart that you stabbed for an hour
Woman, I was freaking out because I want you to know
My beloved, you are the lover of my impossible soul

Woman, too, promise me you'll stay and put off all your woes
I was wigging out, too much worry, I could not get you at all
And you said what you want, you would laugh it off
But I know you won't go, not for it at last, must you write it off for the impossible soul?

And I was in a dream, I was gone away without you, but not too slow
Lest I put it off, for I put it right for the impossible soul
And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all my life to you, if I could get you at all
Don't be a wreck, trying to be something that I wasn't at all

Seems I got it wrong, I was chasing after something that was gone
To the black of night, now I know it's not what I wanted at all
And you said something like, "All you want is all the world for yourself"
But all I want is the perfect love though I know it's small, I want love for us all

All I couldn't sing, I would say it all my life to you, if I could get you at all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, trying to be something that I wasn't at all

Do you want to be afraid?
Do you want to be afraid?
For life in the cage where courage's mate runs deep in the wake
For the scariest things are not half as enslaved

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be alone?
Do you want to be alone?
For life isn't stained of righteousness pain
The seed and the hail, all impossible flights for an interesting light

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to love me more?
Do you want to love me more?
For love is the breath if water and wave
Is cursed by the same thing that nurtured its shame, is it worth all the work?

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
Have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
Instead of the life, lived tired and lost, have you left it at last
Where it floundered its death with the language of ghosts

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be afraid? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
Do you want to be afraid? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
For life in the cage where where courage's mate runs deep in the wake
For the scariest things are not half as enslaved

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted now

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted

Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest
All my delight, all that mattered, I couldn't be at rest
From what I liked, from what I gathered, I couldn't be at rest
Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest

And don't be shy in the window, come down and give your best
Oh delight in the window I couldn't be at rest
Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest
From what I liked, from what I gathered, I couldn't give my best

Oh I know it wasn't safe
It wasn't safe to breathe at all (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
Oh I know it wasn't safe (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
It wasn't safe to creep or crawl (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)

Oh I know it wasn't safe (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
It wasn't safe to breathe at all (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
Oh I know it wasn't safe (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
It wasn't safe to speak at all (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)

Hold on Suf, hold on Suf

I never meant to cause you pain
My burden is the weight of a feather
I never meant to lead you on
I only meant to please me, however

And then you tell me, "Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more together
Boy, we can do much more together"

I'm nothing but a selfish man
I'm nothing but a privileged peddler
And did you think I'd stay the night?
And did you think I'd love you forever?

And then you tell me, "Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more together
Boy, we can do much more together"

I gotta tell you girl, I want nothing less
Girl, I want nothing less
Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure
Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure

I gotta tell you, boy, we made such a mess
Boy, we made such a mess
Boy, we made such a mess together
Boy, we made such a mess together

Boy, we made such a mess together
Boy, we made such a mess together
Boy, we made such a mess together
Boy, we made such a mess together
