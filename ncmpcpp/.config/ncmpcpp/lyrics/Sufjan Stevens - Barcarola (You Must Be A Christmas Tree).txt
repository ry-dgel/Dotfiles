Oh, no one else is happily
Recklessly asking for more than
What they may need
I can't say what I need

Oh, temper what you say if you've
Nothing nice to say
So my grandmother says to me
With her heart on her sleeve

So, sadly I left the door
Open and I let the dog out in the snow
Oh where did she go?

Oh, father friend, will you punish me, punish me
With a look of contempt, with a look of contempt
I can recall

Oh, I know you did right by me, right by me
Wagging your hands when you found me
With a bag of your things

Please, please don't be a stranger here
A stranger who takes from the world
Who takes from the world

You, you must be a Christmas tree, a Christmas tree
You light up the room, oh, you light up the room
Oh you light up the room

So, suddenly you kiss me
You tickled me in front of your mother
Who looked away
With her hands on her face

Don't run away my friend
You won't be back again
You said you needed me
But I know that you needed yourself to be cleaned of me

Don't run away my friend
You won't be back again
You said you needed me
But I know that you needed yourself to be cleaned of me

Don't run away my friend
You won't be back again
You ran your hands through my hair in the snow
Where the frost of it blows with the terrible ghost

Don't run away my friend
You won't be back again
You said you needed me
But I know...
