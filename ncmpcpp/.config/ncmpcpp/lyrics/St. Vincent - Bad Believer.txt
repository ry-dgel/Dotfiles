What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?

From the nave and down into the altar
I left my momma sitting in the pew
Knelt before the trembling pastor
Fainted as he touched my trembling hand

[Chorus:]
What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?

Momma held me up through the rapture
Dragged me through the eyes and the whispers
Lost the spirit out the car window
Bad by righteous, righteous hands

[Chorus]

But now I'm not afraid
I know that love is stranger
Held up and arriving in the light
No I'm not ashamed
There really is no danger
Give me life
Give me life
Give me life

[Chorus x2]
