Havana moon
You got me in the strangest mood
Just me myself no-one else
Could ever be so blue
No backstreet woman
No grand hotel
The only face - out of place
An empty shell
I want to be alone
Me myself no-one else
I want to be alone
Havana moon
Nobody knows me like you do
Nowhere to turn I never learn
I can't break through
No backstreet woman
No grand hotel
The only face - out of place
An empty shell

I want to be alone
Me myself no-one else
I want to be alone

You make me nervous
You telephone
You drive me crazy

I want to be alone
I want to be alone
Me myself no-one else
I want to be alone
