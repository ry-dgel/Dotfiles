He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Jewel box life diamond nights and ruby lights, high in the sky
Heaven help him, when he falls 
Diamond life, lover boy
He move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights 

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start 

No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator 

Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale 

Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the chase 

A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold 

No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator 

Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale 

Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
