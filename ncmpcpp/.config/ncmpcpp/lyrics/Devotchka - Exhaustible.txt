You and I look good together
This day is getting a lot better
Let's get inside out of this weather
And there is no one loves you better
Than me my dear

You and I, we're not so different
Exhaustible and inefficient
Following our intuition
To get back home
To get back home again

Our departure hour is getting closer
You are glowing like phosphorous 
Of all the things I'll miss the most
If we ever get back home

You and I can conquer distance
Space and time and mass resistance
And I really must insist
You come with me my dear
Come with me my dear

You and I we're not so different
Exhaustible and inefficient
You and I look good together
Let's get inside out of this weather
There is no one loves you better
There is no one loves you better
Than me my dear
Than me my dear
