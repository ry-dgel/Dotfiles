And a feel, and a love, and a joy to getA take and a give, blame myself to itA fear and a touch, be afraid of wait          
           Fears and laugh, breath deep in myself

So I'm going nowhere
Going nowhere I belong
I'm going nowhere
Nowhere I belong

And a feel, and a love, and a joy to get
A take and a give, blame myself to it
A fear and a touch, be afraid of wait
Fears and laugh, breath deep in myself

Nowhere, nowhere I belong
