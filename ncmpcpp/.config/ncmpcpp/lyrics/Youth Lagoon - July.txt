Explosions pillaging the night 
From the fireworks on the fourth of July 
It's just my lady, our friends, and I 
Smoking cigars and yelling at cars as they drive by

We scaled a ladder ascending to the roof 
While five years ago I weeped and no one knew
Holding my guitar, I strummed a tune 
I sang "I love you but I have to cut you loose"

As the neighbor lights off the small bombs we watch 
from the rooftop... safely, so safely

If I had never let go, then only God knows where I would be now
I made a bridge between us then I slowly burned it 
Five years ago, in my backyard I sang love away
Little did I know that real love had not quite yet found me
