I wanna spend my life with a girl like you
And do all the things that you want me to
Till that time has come that we might live as one
Can I dance with you?

I tell by the way you dress that you're so refined
And by the way you talk that you're just my kind
Girl, why should it be that you don't notice me
Can I dance with you?

Baby, baby, is there no chance
I can take you for the last dance
All night long, yeah, I've been waiting
Now there'll be no hesitating

So before this dance has reached the end
To you across the floor, my love I'll send
I just hope and pray that I'll find a way to say
Can I dance with you? Can I dance with you?
Can I dance with you? Can I dance with you?
