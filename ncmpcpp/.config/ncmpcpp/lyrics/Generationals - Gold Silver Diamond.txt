Love is not a hug, you don't say it back
s it all turns gold, money as you leaving, leaving
nd the gold, not the way you hide your act
         
           Not the way you comb YOUR HAIR
Only way you're going, going anywhere

You can feel the pain inside
No matter what you do
Because you know it's only fate that can know you
Even if it burns your back
Still right in front of you
In the moment when you thinking it's true

But it was time for a while
It was time, it was never nothing special
You decide every time how you flow

Love is not a hug, you don't say it back
As it all turns gold, money as you leaving, leaving
And the gold, not the way you hide your act
Not the way you comb your hair
Only way you're going, going anywhere

When it challenges you, stand here, you'll be running soon
I can see it already, your fate
When you saw the sirens that were burning through your eyelids
Even when you're running, it come what may

But it was time for a while
It was time, it was never nothing special
You decide every time how you flow

Love is not a hug, you don't say it back
As it all turns gold, money as you leaving, leaving
And the gold, not the way you hide your act
Not the way you comb your hair
Only way you're going, going anywhere
