I was wrong and you were cold
I was hoping you might go
You would never show me how
Much you cared of what was going on

I follow you
Pretend you want me to
Living a test
Locked up with you
I know you trust me enough
Then i do stupid things
The things i always do
This time with you
Our love is new

It's been too long since you are gone
I am thinking of you alone
You would never show me how
Much you scared of what was going on

I follow you
Pretend you need me to
Living a test
Locked up with you
I know you trust me enough
But i do stupid things
The things i always do
This time with you
Our love is new

I need someone to be close forever
