I slipped out the front door
Went out in the night
Took out a cigarette
Then i felt for my light
In my front pocket
It was nowhere to be found

I went back in the door
Kicked off both of my shoes
I looked around for your coat
And then went looking for you
Thought that i heard your laugh
Come tripping(?) down the stairs

I walked carefully up
Til i was almost halfway
I saw two closed doors
So i let my heart break
Are you running around or just running away

Why do i
Always find the worst in you
Do you always find the worst in me
And do i only find the worst in you

So i stood still for a while
Trying to hear agin
But then from the living room
I heard you calling my name
I found you smiling
Asking me where i had been

Why do i
Always seek the worst in you
Do you always seek the worst in me
Do i only seek the worst in you
