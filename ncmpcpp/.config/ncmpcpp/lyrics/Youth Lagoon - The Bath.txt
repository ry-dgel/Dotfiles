The water talks to me. 
t teaches me to swim. 
atching myself bathe 
         
           without ever going in. 
The current sings to me 
in crowning harmony. 
A reel without film. 
To watch is not to see. 

If doomsday's coming, let the earth attack. 
And while the crowd is running, I'll be here instead. The village green, far from the beachhead. 
Your demon met me here. (x3)

I'm watching smoke 
billow from my mouth, 
I take off my shirt. 
This river flows South. 
The stranger's a deer, 
camping in the foothills. 
It lived another year 
without becoming roadkill. 

If doomsday's coming, let the earth attack. 
And while the crowd is running, I'll be here instead. The village green, far from the beachhead. 
Your demon met me here. (x3)
