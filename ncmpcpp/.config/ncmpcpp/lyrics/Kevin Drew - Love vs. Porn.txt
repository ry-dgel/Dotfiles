Well, I woke up and my mouth was a little dry
So I grabbed the moisturizer and tried not to cry
Spoke to my hand and then started to dream

You came into my bed and I tied you up
We went underneath and I taught you the cup
While people were watching how you and me breathed

And I got lost in the warm
And I got lost in the hole
And I got lost in the arms
The softness I'd stolen was never round to be loved

So, I got addicted to watching the screen
That kids today are kept pictures sex-clean
And all the time the body slowly broke apart

No one knows any more how to cum inside
It's all about the dirt we hide in our pride
And tissues become a slow and wasted heart

We'll get lost in the warm
We'll get lost in the hole
We'll get lost in our arms
The softness we stole was never about the love

Ladies on the screen can never replicate
All the fatty lines where the skin ought to take
We must fool our eyes before we even kiss

The joy, the joy used to be in all the books
Kids today think that hookers are the hook 
And that hearts beat better in a bed when they're missed

And they'll get lost in the warm
And they'll get lost in the holes
And they'll get lost in the arms
The softness they stole will never ever be able to love
