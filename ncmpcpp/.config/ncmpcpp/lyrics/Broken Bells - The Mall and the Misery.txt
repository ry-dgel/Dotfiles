Use your intuition it's all you've got
Keys are rare and there's a thousand locks
Stand in your way
So goes the gold age… your tired life
Digging for a way you cast a spell
Carve a path from all the things they sell
But they don't let go
Just thought you should know… either way
 
I know what I know would not fill a thimble
So let my mind go straight down the runway
Does one want to get more used to
The mall and misery the debt mounts
The cost to be alive
 
Your eyes are burning from the biting cold
If only to learn what you've never been told
That there's a real world
And somewhere a good girl… lives and breathes
Powdered hope in my callow mind
An idea stolen by the morning tide
Now there's a dark time
And this is your dark rhyme… to fill your heart

I know what I know would not fill a thimble
So let my mind go straight down the runway
Does one want to get more used to
The mall and misery the debt mounts
The cost to be alive
