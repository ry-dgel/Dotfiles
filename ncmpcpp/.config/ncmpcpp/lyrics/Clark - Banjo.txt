She's a long way from Houston, long way from those Texas blues
And she came down from Telluride on a steam train bound for somewhere new.
There's a rainbow in the mountains and she's waiting on the sun to shine on through.
You can't tell the tears from the rain if you ain't walked a mile in her boots.

Standing in the rain in Durango
Right side of wrong, wrong side of gone
Standing in the rain in Durango
She's waiting on some cowboy to lasso her heart and take her home.

Fell in with some field hippies went needle dancing in a tie dye dress.
Then a Rocky Mountain rain came and they all got soakin' wet.
She wound up with a backstage pass, hangin' with the pickers in the band,
'Til her heart got broke by a banjo man, now she's had all the bluegrass she can stand.

Standing in the rain in Durango
Right side of wrong, wrong side of gone
Standing in the rain in Durango
She's just waiting on some cowboy to lasso her heart and take her home.

She had all of her belongings in a cardboard suitcase sittin' by her side.
And she had no destination, she was just lookin' for a ride.
So he pulled up in a Mustang, she got in and they just rode away.
Headed west into the sunset, mascara runnin' down her face.

Standing in the rain in Durango
Right side of wrong, wrong side of gone
Standing in the rain in Durango
She's waiting on some cowboy to lasso her heart and take her home.

Standing in the rain in Durango.
