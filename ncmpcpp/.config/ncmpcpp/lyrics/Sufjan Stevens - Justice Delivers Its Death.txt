Silver and gold, silver and gold
Everyone wishes for it
How do you measure its worth?
Just by the pleasure it gives here on earth.

Oh, I'm getting old
Oh, I'm getting old
Everyone wishes for youth 
How have I wasted my life? 
Trusting the pleasure it gives here on earth

Lord, come with fire
Lord, come with fire
Everyone's wasting their time 
Storing up treasure in vain
Trusting the pleasure it gives here on earth

Oh, I see the end
Oh, I see the end
Everyone's waiting for death 
How do you measure its worth?
Justice delivers its gift here on earth

Silver and gold, silver and gold
Silver and gold, silver and gold
