You've expressed explicitly your contempt for matrimony
You've student loans to pay and will not risk the alimony
We spend our days locked in a room content inside a bubble
and in the night time we go out and scour the streets for trouble
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
During the summer take me sailing out on the Atlantic
I won't set my sights on other seas, there is no need to panic
So honey take me by the hand and we can sign some papers
Forget the invitations floral arrangements and bread makers
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
Too late to go out
Too young to stay in
You're talking about
We're standing in sin
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
Hey, hey A-R-C-H-I-E yeah
