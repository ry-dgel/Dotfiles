You can have it if you don't mind some or all the others stay with me
You confuse me with your riddles and your sudden generosity

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

You can have it when you come by, you can have yourself a one-man way
I saw you when it caught your eye and it's such a petty price to pay

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

Take one if you need it but you really shouldn't be out this late
Really wanna make you feel home
Take one if you need it but you really shouldn't get this fucked up
Really wanna get it to you

Slide another shot by and wipe your dirty hands on me
Swallow till you go blind and find a little company

Call me in the afternoon even by one by one

After all, when I listen, it could be you, could be anyone that I want
