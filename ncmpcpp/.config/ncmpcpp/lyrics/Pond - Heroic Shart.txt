Baby, can't you see? You only pity me
I didn't ask for your simple thing, oh, it (?)

Would it set me free? Would it give me, oh?
Would it work for me if my heroes were untold?

Honey, what are you doing here? Babe, there must be something clear
You stay inside, are you just a child, are you from here?

Would it set me free? Would it give me, oh?
Would it work for me if my heroes were untold?

Would it set me free? Would it work for me, oh?
Would it work for me if my heroes were untold?
Would it set me free? Would it give me, oh?
Would it work for me if the audience were told?
