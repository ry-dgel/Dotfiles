I think I'll go home and mull this over
Before I cram it down my throat
At long last it's crashed, its colossal mass
Has broken up into bits in my moat

Rip the mattress off the floor
Walk the cramps off, go meander in the cold
Hail to your dark skin, hiding the fact you're dead again
Underneath the power lines seeking shade

Far above our heads
Are the icy heights that contain all reason

It's a luscious mix of words and tricks
That let us bet when you know we should've fold
On rocks I dreamt of where we'd stepped
And of the whole mess of roads we're now on

Hold your glass up, hold it in
Never betray the way you've always known it is
One day I'll be wondering how I got so old just wondering how
Never got cold wearing nothing in the snow

This is way beyond
My remote concern of being condescending
All these squawking birds won't quit
Building nothing, laying bricks

Hold your glass up, hold it in
Never betray the way you've always known it is
One day I'll be wondering how I got so old just wondering how
Never got cold wearing nothing in the snow

This is way beyond
My remote concern of being condescending
All these squawking birds won't quit
Building nothing, laying bricks
