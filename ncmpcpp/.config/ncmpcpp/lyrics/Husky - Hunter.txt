Come now, sister, don't you wait for the sky to clear
I have never seen it rain so truly
Let's find somewhere to sleep, this bus stop's sinking like a pier
They can wait till morning or a week or two

I came here not for love but for the possibility
Of setting free the love we knew for all of time
Don't you remember I said that I would not forget?
Your memory is safe with me and you're heavenly

The strangest things come to me in my sleep
Climb the rolling hills ever so steep
And I don't recognize you, nor you me
Still we know each other so well

I will be the hunter and you can light the fire
Keep it burning until I return
As darkness falls I'll prove it in time to you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

All the way to whaler's cove, the country side and me
Every little thing still in its place
If it were that I was where I thought that I would be
Surely I would know it in my bones

I came here not for love but for the possibility
Of setting free the love we knew for all of time
Don't you remember that I said that I would not forget?
Your memory is safe with me and you're heavenly

The only thing I know is I'm not sure
Where I left the keys to all the doors
And now that I am here
I don't know why everybody looks the same

I will be the hunter, you can light the fire
Keep it burning until I return
As darkness falls I'll prove it in time to you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
