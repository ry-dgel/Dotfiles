New York, I love you
But you're bringing me down
New York, I love you
But you're bringing me down

Like a rat in a cage
Pulling minimum wage
New York, I love you
But you're bringing me down

New York, you're safer
And you're wasting my time
Our records all show
You were filthy but fine

But they shuttered your stores
When you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored
Once they'd run out of crime

New York, you're perfect
Oh please, don't change a thing
Your mild billionaire mayor's
Now convinced he's a king

So the boring collect
I mean all disrespect
In the neighborhood bars
I'd once dreamt I would drink

New York, I love you
But you're freaking me out
There's a ton of "The Twist"
But we're fresh out of "Shout!"

Like a death in the hall
That you hear through your wall
New York, I love you
But you're freaking me out

New York, I love you
But you're bringing me down
New York, I love you
But you're bringing me down

Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start?
But you're still the one pool
Where I'd happily drown

And oh, take me off your mailing list
For kids who think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists

Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right

Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right

And oh..
Maybe mother told you true
And there'll always be somebody there for you
And you'll never be alone

But maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong

Maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And if so, here's this song
