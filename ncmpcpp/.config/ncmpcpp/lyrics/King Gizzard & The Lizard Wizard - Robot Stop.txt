Loosen up
Time to drop
Fuck shit up
Don't forget about it
My coffin's all I see
Lately
Robot stop

Loosen up
Time to drop
Fuck shit up
Don't forget
My coffin's all I see
Lately
Robot stop

My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more

One two three!

Limber up
Time is up
Fuck shit up
Don't forget about it
My coffin's all I see
Lately
Robot stop

My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

Upload me to the robot brain
I'm the drudge that goes again and again

Bring the spooks to the beer-soaked glade
The robots here of the the robots paid

My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more

One two three!
