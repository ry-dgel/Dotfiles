It doesn't seem I was wrong
It takes some time to get on, I...
I feel I'm alone
It doesn't seem I was right
Takes time to get on, I...
I need to go home

And everything that I love
Has been deceived
Everyone who's loved my can't believe
What I see is possible for me
But it seems impossible to reach

I sat down with tragedy
I spent my whole life
To know why I believe
I broke down the walls I keep
I need to know why
The world has abandoned me

I'm losing sight of my life
I'm wasting way too much time
Could there ever be another apology
Abuse mine

And everything that I love
Has been deceived
Everyone who's loved my can't believe
What I see is possible for me
But it seems impossible to reach

I sat down with tragedy
I spent my whole life
To know why I believe
I broke down the walls I keep
I need to know why
The world has abandoned me

I can't
You can't
We can't let this go [6x]

I sat down with tragedy
I spent my whole life
To know why I believe
I broke down the walls I keep
I need to know why
The world has abandoned me
