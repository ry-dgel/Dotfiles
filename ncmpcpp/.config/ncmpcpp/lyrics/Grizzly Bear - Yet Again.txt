Yet again we're the only ones
No surprise this is often how it's done
Lately it's about all I can take
I will move and mend and mold this break

Shell with another crack
I'm small but I can keep track
Too soon everyone just step away
I'm sure this isn't the last play

Take it all in stride
Speak don't confide
We barely had a case

It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take score even playing fields this game
I know when all's said we're the same
If I could I would leave it all be
No chance to move backwards and see

Take it all in stride
Speak don't confide
We barely had a case

It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take it all in stride
Speak don't confide
We barely had a case

It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face
