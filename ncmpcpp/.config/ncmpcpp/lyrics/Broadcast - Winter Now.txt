Snow lies all around
There's no sense of doubt
You are the only one 
To keep me sane when all is wrong

Oh my heart
Waits in winter now

Deep in every dream
Though you're far from me
There in the deepest snow
I only wanted you to know

Oh my heart
Waits in winter now

Falling quietly 
There reminding me
Though it's just a dream
You're closer than you've ever been

Oh my heart waits in winter now
