Look upon the field of snow 
To find the desert sea
Under the ice the springs will flow to release
Fecundities like a natural disaster

From the first drop of water
To the rage of Niagara

Collapse upon the forest floor and down upon your knees
Anthurium Lacrimae decays underneath the canopies like a natural disaster
It's the one that's been happening over and over and over again

No peace in the valleys
Malarial alleys where the kittens have pleurisy
Donning our goggles
Valerian ogles
To see microscopically
A colony of dermestids 
Undressed and digested 
A grey spotted owl 
And a wolf with a lung disease

Collapse upon the forest floor and down upon your knees
Anthurium Lacrimae decays underneath the canopies like a natural disaster
It's the one that keeps happening over and over and over again
