Soon I'm gonna marry a man like no other
Light the fuse, hallelujah, hallelujah

Love, love is the warmest colour
Petrol blues, hallelujah, hallelujah

Come, saut dans le vide, my love
In my youth the greatest tide washed up my prize

You

Follow, let him go, let him lead me be
Love is a pharaoh, and in front of me
I thought let him be where he want to be
Love is a pharaoh and he's boning me

I've discovered a man like no other man
I've found a love to love like no other can
He's found me, my Aslan

Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
Marry a man like no other

Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
Love is the warmest colour

Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
Unpin your butterflies, Russia

Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
To be a deer in Nara

Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
