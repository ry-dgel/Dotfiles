I am the cavalry captain
I am the remedy to your heart
I am the common collective
I am imprinted upon your stars

And when you shine, shine your eyes
Looking lost, looking bright
We'll away on the light brigade

And if only for a second
(Only for a second)
And if only for a time
(Only for a time)
And if only for a second
(Only for a second)
And if only for a time
We'll be alive
We'll be alive

I am the cavalry captain
I am the remedy to your heart
I am the common collective
I am imprinted upon your stars

There is a world, there is a time
Looking calm, looking kind
We'll away at the break of day

And if only for a second
(Only for a second)
And if only for a time
(Only for a time)
And if only for a second
(Only for a second)
And if only for a time
We'll be alive
We'll be alive
(Only for a second)
(Only for a second)
(Only for a second)
(Only for a second)

I am the cavalry captain
(Only for a second)
I am the remedy to your heart
(Shine, shine your eyes)
I am the common collective
(Looking lost, looking bright)
I am imprinted upon your stars
(We'll away on the light brigade)
(If only for a second)
(When you shine, shine your eyes)
(I am the cavalry captain)
(Looking lost, looking bright)
(I am the remedy to your heart)
(We'll away on the light brigade)
