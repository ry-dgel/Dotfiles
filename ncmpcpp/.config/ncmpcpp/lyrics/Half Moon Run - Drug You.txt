Drugs you
Take to reveal it
All your wishes come true

I still am full of hate
I still am full of pride
I still am full of hate
I still am full of pride

Is it all that you need
When it's all that you got
Is it all that you need
Cuz it's all that I want
When it's all that you need
Cuz it's all that you got
Then it's all that you want
And it's all that I'm not

Still as rain
Fallin down

Still as rain
Fallin down

Drug you
