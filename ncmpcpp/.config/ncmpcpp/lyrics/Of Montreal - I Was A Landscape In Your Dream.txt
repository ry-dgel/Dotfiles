What kind of comedy is this? -- all of the danger you've discovered.
What kind of comedy is this? -- how can you say now, you're frightened?
You labeled me in forty tries and in case you didn't realize,
I was a landscape in your dream and all my mountains were on fire.

What kind of labyrinth is this that we're constructing through talking?
What kind of labyrinth is this that sends you laughing without smiling?
Age brings a sad little surprise and in case you didn't realize,
While you were calculating tears, my head expired.
