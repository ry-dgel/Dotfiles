Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing

Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
Let all their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove 
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders, of his love

Boy, we can do much more together
It's not so impossible
Boy, we can do much more together
It's not so impossible
Boy, we can do much more together
It's not so impossible
Boy, we can do much more together

Do you see what I see?
