We're glad that you came
We need someone to look up to
Show us the way cause some say
We've been using the wrong tools

Don't say that we'll pale into the background
Don't say that we'll fail even if luck's around

Pressure from above and below
None of us know who we are
Since finding a mirror in words
Some of us have lost heart

Don't say that we'll pale into the background
Don't say that we'll fail even if luck's around

We're glad that you're here
We need someone to relate to
Show us the way cause we need
A place to escape to

Don't say that we'll pale into the background
Don't say that we'll fail even if luck's around
