In the field, I wait for the morning
When they fly, over a dream
Come and call for me
Boyfriend, come and play
When they feel I never found the weighted bells

We like them all, come in the morning
In the sky, counting away
Hope to send them now, play your winded night
From the ground
Reach out from the ground
