Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
To get so up for it

Know you can count on me
I'll be so up for it
Know at least I'll try

Who are you if you're not up for it
Where are you if I'm not up for it

Want to put a bubble round you
Like a force field switch
Keep you secure just a little bit

But I know a secret child is just a silly trick
Who grows up to lose that force field switch

In between a hands on and a hands off apprenticeship
Where are you if I'm not up for it
I'll wake up for it

Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
To get so up for it

Know you can count on me
I'll be so up for it
Know at least I'll try
