I do relate to you in so many ways
But I didn't go through what you must have in those early days
You had to be strong at such a very young age
A new life on Ilima Lane 

So won't you listen to me now
There's something I never told you
And I'm about to try
See you were my lifeline when the world was exploding

You moved back in with us in the fall of '82
I fell into dark times and you were there to help me through
You told me that a downturn would eventually improve
And you were right, so I'm thanking you

So won't you listen to me now
There's something I never told you
And I'm about to try
See you were my lifeline when the world was exploding
Footholds eroding

Had you never been my friend
I wouldn't be quite what you see
I wouldn't be the man I am

Sister you've known me
Lost in a strange world
What has it shown me?
What has it unfurled?
Sister you've known me
Been lost in a strange world
But what has it shown me?
What has it unfurled?

October chill in that old dusty town
Halloween came, I was still feeling down
Mom, lost my sweet tooth, what's the point in going 'round?
Your boy is losing count
"Maybe try the lost and found"
