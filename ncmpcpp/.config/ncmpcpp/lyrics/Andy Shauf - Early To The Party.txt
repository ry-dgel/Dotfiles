Early to the party
You're the first one there
Overdressed and underprepared
Standing in the kitchen
Stressing out the host
Pulling teeth til anyone arrives

Excuse yourself and smoke a cigarette outside
The same new faces coming up the drive
Ask him of his cravings as they shuffle past
Can't he ever show up on time?

Bird on the wall
Catch her calling all the shots
Catch her tying you in knots
Won't let you leave

What happened to manners
I guess he's had a few
He's talking shit
He never thinks of you
So bite your lip and watch him off with his friends
Leaving you all alone once again

Bird on the wall
Catch her calling all the shots
Catch her tying you in knots
Won't let you leave
Bird on the wall
Catch her calling all the shots
Catch her tying you in knots
Won't let you leave
Bird on the wall
Catch her calling all the shots
Catch her tying you in knots
Never lets you leave
