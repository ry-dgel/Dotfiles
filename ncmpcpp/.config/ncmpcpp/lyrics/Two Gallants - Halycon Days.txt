When jealousy raps on the door 
Well what have you come here for"
To whisper your dreams away
         
           
They say you've loved too hard 
Enough to enrage the gods
And now there's hell to pay"

And with your name upon my lips 
i sunk down 
and relived your farewell kiss 
as i drowned

so i went off in search of advice 
though you warned me to think twice 
"I see death on the sea my love"

I sais "i'll return before long
and we'll live in the light of the dawn" 
we heard faint laughter above

And with your name upon my lips
No one's ever loved like this 
i sunk down 
and relived your farewell kiss 
as i drowned

Run and see run to the shore
and at your feet on waves I'll roll
Still asleep drenched to the core
and we will love like gods once more
