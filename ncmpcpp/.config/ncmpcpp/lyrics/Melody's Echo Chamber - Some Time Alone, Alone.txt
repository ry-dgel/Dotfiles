We resigned the light to someone and handed to the righteous
We will walk until the right ocean
Some time alone, alone to wonder, change your mind and on
Waiting around while everyone else is moving on and on, and on

Empty heart, it's not the same at all
Turn around and I'm losing my mind

Baby, you're the one, the one at least until tomorrow, surprise
We should join orion and leave me down
Under the wall, look through your eyes, we never compromised
Used to be walking until the dawn and on, and on until the dawn

Empty heart, some time alone, alone
Turn around and I'm losing my mind
Empty heart, it's not the same at all
Turn around and I'm losing my mind
