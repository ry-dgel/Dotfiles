Bursting through a blood red sky
A slow landslide
and the world we leave behind
It's enough to lose your head,
disappear and not return again...
When I fall to my feet
Wearin' my heart on my sleeve
All I see just don't make sense
You are the port of my call
You shot and leavin' me raw 
Now I know you're amazing

'Cause all I need
Is the love you breathe
put your lips on me 
and I can live underwater,
underwater, underwater!
Underwater!

Flying through a bright blue sky
with a space boy high
from the world I leave behind
It's enough to lose my head
disappear and not be seen again
When I fall to my feet
Wearin' my heart on my sleeve
All I see just don't make sense
You are the port of my call
You shot and leavin' me raw
Now I know you're amazing

'Cause all I need
Is the love you breathe
Put your lips on me and
I can live underwater,
underwater, underwater!
Underwater!

Underwater underwater 
I can live underwater 
With your love I can breathe
I can breathe underwater

Underwater underwater 
We could live underwater 
With your love I can breathe
I can breathe underwater

Underwater underwater 
We could live underwater 
With your love we could breathe
We could breathe underwater
