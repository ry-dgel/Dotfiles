If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain

If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain

In the night forlorn
When the morning's born
And the morning shines
With the lights of love

You will miss sunrise
If you close your eyes
And that would break
My heart in two

The lady's with me now
Since I showed her how
To put her lily
Hand in mine

Loop and Lil agree
She's a sight to see
And a treasure for
The poor to find

If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
