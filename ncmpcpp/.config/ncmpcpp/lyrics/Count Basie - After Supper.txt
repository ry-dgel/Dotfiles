Mmmmm  Mmmmmm  Make yourself comfortable.Mmmmm  Mmmmmm  Make yourself comfortable.Mmmmm  Mmmmmm  Make yourself comfortable, baby.          
           
Take off your shoesies, dear,
And loosen up your tie.
I've got some records here.
Let's try one on for size.
I'll turn the lights down 
While you make yourself comfortable, baby.

We hurried through our dinner,  Hurried through the dance,
Left before the picture show was through.
Why did we hurry through our dinner,  
Hurry through the dance.
To leave some time for this, 
To hug-a hug-a kiss and so now

Mmmmm  Mmmmmm  Make yourself comfortable.
Mmmmm  Mmmmmm  Make yourself comfortable.
Mmmmm  Mmmmmm  Make yourself comfortable, baby.
