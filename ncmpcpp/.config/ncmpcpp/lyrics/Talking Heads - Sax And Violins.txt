Falling, falling
Gonna drop like a stone
I'm falling through the atmosphere
On a warm afternoon
If lovers discover
That everyone dies
So don't tell me, please hold me
It's a dangerous life

Daddy, dear, let's get outta here
I'm scared
Ten o'clock, nighttime in New York
It's weird

If you're looking for trouble
Well, that's what you will find

Mom and Pop, they will fuck you up
For sure
Love so deep, kills you in your sleep
It's true

Love keeps us together
And love will keep us alive

And we are criminals that never broke no laws
And all we needed was a net to break our fall

Ha, they're searching for diamonds
They're grabbing at straws
Sex and sin, sax and violins
It's hell
Wooden heads, furniture with legs
For sale

Love keeps us together
And love will drive us insane

And we are criminals that never broke no laws
And all we needed was a net to break our fall

Going home, back where I belong
To stay
The rays of light, they will turn the night
To day

Birds travel together
Birds follow the sun
And I am watching as the birds go flying home
