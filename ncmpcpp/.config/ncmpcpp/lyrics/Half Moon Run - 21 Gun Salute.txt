21 gun salute
I guess I saw it in my tv show
With the look of the sun on the city-scape
I caught the subway home with a belly-ache

When you look in the face of my friends
When I try to talk with a cloudy head
I keep fucking it up, and it's rough
Maybe it's just that I'm out of luck

It all goes downhill after the rains, after the floods
Only mountains retain the shape, retain the blood
All the secrets you've kept till now, you'll keep till the grave

21 gun salute
I had to put the body to rest
I guess I saw it in my fevered sleep
With a cough to wake up in the morning breeze

It all goes downhill after the rains, after the floods
Only mountains retain the shape, retain the blood
All the secrets you've kept till now you'll keep till the grave

All slow to face when I'm wrong enough
Long shall we wait for another one

It all goes downhill after the rains, after the floods
Only mountains retain the shape, retain the blood
All you seek is gone
