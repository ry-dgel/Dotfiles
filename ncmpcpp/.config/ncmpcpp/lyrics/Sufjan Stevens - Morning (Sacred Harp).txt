And am I born to die
To lay this body down
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown

A land of deepest shade
Unpierced by human thought
The dreary regions of the dead
Where all things are forgot
The dreary regions of the dead
Where all things are forgot

Soon as from earth I go
What will become of me
Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be
Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be

Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be
Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be
