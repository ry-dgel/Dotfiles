Be still for a second while I
Try and try to pin your flowers on
La, la, la, la, la
Can you carry my drink, I have everything else
I can tie my tie all by myself
I'm getting tired, I'm forgetting why

Oh, we're so disarming, darling
Everything we did believe
Is diving, diving, diving
Diving off the balcony

Tired and wired, we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave

Hold ourselves together with our
Arms around the stereo for hours
La, la, la, la, la, la
While it sings to itself or whatever it does
When it sings to itself of its long lost loves
I'm getting tired, I'm forgetting why

Tired and wired, we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave
But I'll be with you behind the couch
When they come on a different day just like this one

We'll stay inside 'til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz for days
We'll stay inside 'til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz

So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks
And perfume

Stay inside 'til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz

So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks
And perfume on
