Oooooh
Some people think they're always right
Others are quiet and uptight
Others they seem so very nice nice nice nice nice oh oh
Inside they might feel sad and wrong

Oh no
29 different attributes
And only 7 that you like, uh oh
20 ways to see the world, oh oh
Or 20 ways to start a fight

Oh, don't, don't, don't
Get up
I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you baby
'Cause I'm through
Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

Ooooooh
Oh, men don't notice what they got
Women think of that a lot
1000 ways to please your man oh oh
Not even one requires a plan. I know
Countless odd religions too
It doesn't matter which you choose
One stubborn way to turn your back
This I've tried, and now refuse

Oh don't don't don't
Get up
I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you, baby
'Cause I'm through
Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

Alright
Shut me up
Shut me up up up up up
And I'll get along with you
