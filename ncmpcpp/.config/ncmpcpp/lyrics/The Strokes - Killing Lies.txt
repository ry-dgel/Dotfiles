Say a prayer now
Don't be scared now
You don't want trouble
Well we might get some

We might get some
It's troublesome
But don't you worry
You can help me

Killing lies

First you're worried
Then you're hurried
Don't think that everything is gonna stay the same
That's impossible

Before I let you go
Let me look at you
Don't you worry
You will help me

Killing lies

Oh yes, I noticed you
You are a friend mine
