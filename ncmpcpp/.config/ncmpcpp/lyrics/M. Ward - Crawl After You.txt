I cannot be depended on to lie here
And casually watch as you go waltzing by
I've been shook so bad that I cannot stand to utilise my feet
So I've got to crawl after you
Tell you who I am

I was raised by a tribe of Vegas cowboys
Who claim I was born from a union of dust and wind
And when I came of age I sailed away
A pinecone on the Rio Grande
Now I've got to crawl after you
Tell you who I am

And today's the day I caught up with you
I see you walking by the cafÃ© mirror
Should I stay here by this bus stop bench
So strange to see you after all these years

I cannot be depended on to lie here
And casually watch as you go waltzing by
I've been shook so bad that I cannot stand to utilise my feet
So I've got to crawl after you
Tell you who I am
