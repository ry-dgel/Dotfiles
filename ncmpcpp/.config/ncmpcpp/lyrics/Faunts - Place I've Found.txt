I was waiting and every day we lost
Losing this was all I had
Every time I looked it was bad
Even while you led me there
If you had left me here with my life
Leave me to this all, I tried
Would you hold me here, so close?
What awaits me in the end?

And I was losing sight of you
Came to only bring me down
And I was losing sight of the view
Take me to that place I've found

Can I go on, while on the ashes we stand
Holding me inside their hands
If you take me there, I will go
And if you take me, then I will know

That I was losing sight of you
Came to only bring me down
And I was losing sight of the view
Take me to that place I've found
