I stood alone, upon the platform in vain
Puerto Ricans they were playing me salsa in the rain 
With open doors and manual locks
In fast food parking lots

I headed West, I was a man on the move
New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
Oh, I need somebody, needed someone I could trust
I don't gamble, but if I did I would bet on us

Like the Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh Lord, like the Dead Sea

Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The nicest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see, 
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

You told me you were good at running away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
You took the rest when you took the map

Yes, there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live
It for yourself you felt, you just felt it was time
And I'm glad, cause you with cats, that's just not right

Like the Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh Lord, I'm your Dead Sea 

Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see
I was born to be, be your dead sea

I been down, I been defeated
You're the message I was heeding
Would you stay, 
Would you stay the night? 

Dead Sea, 
Told me I was like the Dead Sea
Never sink when you are with me
Oh Lord, I'm your Dead Sea

Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
No need to move your feet so quickly
Oh Lord, I'm your Dead Sea
