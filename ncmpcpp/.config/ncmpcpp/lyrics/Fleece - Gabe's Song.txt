I don't mean to trouble your mindI'm just trying to find my way homeSilently I'm seeking a kind of a way to get by on my own          
           
Downtown Saturday
In a better way
Than I ever was before
Don't need anyone
Standing in my sun
Don't need that anymore

Well it's a long way I know
And there's no one way to go
But it's all gonna show in the end

I got to find my way, find my way
Find my way home
I got to find my way, find my way
Find my way home

All those plans that I made for myself
I've got nobody else to lean on
Gone so far with my head in the clouds
Now it's time to come down and be gone

Downtown Saturday
In a better way
Than I ever was before
Don't need anyone
Standing in my sun
Don't need that anymore

All the time in the world
And everything I'll have heard
You know it's all in a word, destiny

I got to find my way, find my way
Find my way home
I got to find my way, find my way
Find my way home
