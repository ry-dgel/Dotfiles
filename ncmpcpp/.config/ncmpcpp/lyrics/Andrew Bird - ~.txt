And now as i would judge and say you're aloof
but you know the truth is a seed
you know what you need is a conflagration
cause when i see the blood
and the bits of your broken tooth
it gives me the proof that i need
it's the proof that you bleed
it's a revelation
yeah it's a revelation, it's a revelation

I thought you were a life-sized paper doll
propped up in the hardware store
propped up on the front lawn watching the parade
of those legionnaires with two-by-four's
as they're marching off to war
yeah they're marching off to war

I didn't know what you were made of
the colour of your blood, what you're afraid of
are you made of calcium or are you carbon-based
and if you're made of calcium i'll have to take a taste
cause, listen, calcium is deadly tender to the tooth
and it's one sure-fire way to know if you're
MX-missile-proof, oh no, or if you're just aloof

You were in the ground in late november
when the leaves in earth are down
did you, did you think they would remember
how you almost made state champion
cause when you're running for the game against alfonso
and you fell upon the ground and chipped a tooth
oh no, listen, i really have surprised her
to learn that you are really MX-missile-proof

Oh, i thought you were a life-sized paper doll
and you're propped up in the hardware store
you were propped up on the front lawn watching the parade of those legionnaires with two-by-four's
as they're marching off to war
yeah they're marching off to war
oh they're marching
