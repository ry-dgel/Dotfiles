Everyone is hiding out
In shacks they built by themselves.
If winter was any colder then they'd freeze.
Everyone is hiding out.

All the spirits in the field.
All of the houses are sealed.
No one is coming or going today.
All the spirits in the field.

A tempest seen over the cliff
Is set to hit the monolith.
It's not much surprise in it coming today,
A tempest seen over the cliff.

Evil is in the air, I'm not coming out, out, out.
Bundled up scared, huddled on the corner of the couch, couch, couch.
And Jamie's not here, she is on the other side of town, town.

The howling of dogs echo in every inch of the house, house, house.
The knock on my door before it collapses to the ground, ground, ground.
But Jamie's not here, she is on the other side of town, town.

A pause in the speech.
All mouths watering.
The garden of earth
It blooms in the seed.
I welcome the leech
That lived in your birth.
