If you really wanted me to know
Then you've sure got a funny way of showing
El Caporal
El Caporal
El Caporal
You're money's no good here

Well if you really don't want me to know
Then you sure got a silly way of showing
El Caporal
El Caporal
El Caporal
My dog's not in your dumpster

Slide through your life
Straight like a knife
Sway when you dance
Play a game in your pants
It's all new you see
The believing in things
Believing in things that I do

Have we played all the chords we can finger?
Have we made all the musical shapes?
I just hope that my kisses, love will linger
On your sweet, confused captain's face

And the things you say just aren't making any sense
And the wars you wage are mostly killing innocents
When I want to say, all that's good has gone away
You tell me no, it isn't so

But if you really wanted me to know
Then you sure got a funny way of showing
El Caporal
El Caporal
Your love lasted forever
Your love lasted forever
