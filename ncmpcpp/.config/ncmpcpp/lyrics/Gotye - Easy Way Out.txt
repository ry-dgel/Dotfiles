Seventeen seconds and I'm over it
Ready for the disconnect
Putting on a brave face
Trying not to listen
To the voices in the back of my head

But it's alright now
(It's a distant memory baby)
Alright now
(You know you should just let it go)

Some feelings have a habit of persisting
Even though you wouldn't let it show

Wearing me out
(All this)
Hanging around
(It just starts)
Getting me down
('Til I'm just)
Looking for an easy way out

Brain-dead from boredom
I'm led to distraction
Scratching the surface of life
Nothing really happens
But it's easy to keep busy
When you tell yourself you're traveling right

But it's alright now
(Was it really worth it baby?)
Alright now
(Was it just a waste of time?)

Keep on second-guessing
Use my memory like a weapon
On everything I try

Wearing me out
(All this)
Hanging around
(It just starts)
Getting me down
('Til I'm just)
Looking for an easy way out

Wearing me out
(But it's alright now)
Hanging around
(Alright now)
Getting me down
(But it's alright now)
Looking for an easy way out
