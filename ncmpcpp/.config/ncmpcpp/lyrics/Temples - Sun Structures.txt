The weather shaking fast
All in till summer last
All the rocky cold
If they put to rest a long lost fortune

Carry on to the distance of
Rarely squaring in the eyes of the one
Even brace while in the gun
Legacy waiting for a long lost fortune

Take a path of you, inside the odyssey
Ritualistic signs on the desert sea
Lead the river to the water
Take the fire from the trees

(Ah, ah)

All in all in the time of the last
Ceremonial prayer to the grass
Sink the ground where the image falls
If they put trust to a long lost fortune

Carry on to the far side
Cross the side to the eyes of the one
Rest in grace where the echo young
Legacy waits for the long lost fortune

Take a path of you, inside the odyssey
Ritualistic signs on the desert sea
Lead the river to the water
Take the fire from the trees
