This goose is cooked, these tongues are tied
Around the block an airborne blight
But looking on the brighter side
There's far less to which I'd be obliged

In the meadow where the black breeze blows
Where underneath the waves, you were most alone
Can you hear a subtle, aching tone?
Through the water, through the earth, to chill your bones

Looking on the brighter side
Looking on the brighter side
Looking on the brighter side
Looking on the brighter side
