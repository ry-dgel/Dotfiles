If you say it is, then I guess it is
What you say it is, but I don't feel anything
Cause your pendulum is in swing again
Yeah, your pendulum hasn't swung back in

It's a champagne year
Through the sober months
Through my maudlin days
Through my dry moments

I saw the Northern Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the Northern Northern Lights

Gotta get young fast
Gotta get young quick
Gotta make this last
If it makes me sick

I saw the Northern Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the Northern Northern Lights
Convinces it was the end of times

I saw the Northern Northern Lights (x4)
