You don't know I sing these songs
About you
You don't know the pseudonyms I assume
You don't know the pseudonyms I assume
For you

Are you happier now
That the Gods are dying?
Or do you dream of
Heston with omniscient beard

You should be happier now
With no one to pray to
Or would you love to
Break your knees from beggin' and prayin'

Bite hard, well it's a broken smile
Breaking their hearts and breaking their minds
Bite hard, it's a 505
Your engine's alive, we ride together
Bite hard, bite hard

I may be lonelier now
But I'm happy alone, honest
I ain't lonely alone
What would we talk about anyway?

No, I'd never resort
To kissing your photo, honest
I just had to see
How the chemicals taste there, honey

Bite hard, well it's a broken smile
Breaking their hearts and breaking their minds
Bite hard, it's a 505
Your engine's alive, we ride together
We ride together
We die together

Bite hard, oh
Bite hard, oh
Oh, bite hard

Oh, I never
I never
I never
No, I never

I just had to
I just had to
I just had to see her, honey

Bite hard, well it's a broken smile
Breaking their hearts and breaking their minds
Bite hard, it's a 505
Your engine's alive, we ride together
We ride together
We die together
