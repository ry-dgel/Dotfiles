Say it all,
Just get it all off your chest
Shake it up, 500000 times
Say no more, we don't believe anything
Teenage angst, I only know

Baby, show me where to go
Some things, I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
I wanna die

Say no more, I'm not awake anymore
Changed my mind 2000 times before
Seen a knight dance on the side of the road
Teenage angst, I only know
 
Baby, show me where to go
Some things, I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
I wanna die! 

Feel the dizzy...
Feel the running show
All I want to see
All I want to know
Watch you as you stay
Faces at your door
Waiting for your piers
Call each other, please

Baby, show me where to go
Some things, I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
I wanna die
