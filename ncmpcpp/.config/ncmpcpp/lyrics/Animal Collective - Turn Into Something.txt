Oh twisted me, I came to eat at the hall where we danced to some duds
My crowd of pals observed my fingers and prayed for the lunch I had hung
And cheers rolled out and I thought early of tunas in tenison's tubs

That should turn into something
You should turn into something

Oh blissful bleed, I came out peaking and leaked out like a wet clown
My tears rolled down and arms went round at night, I gapped at her gowns
So often green but she held me my curtains were covered in hounds

She said, "Oh my sweet goodness wish you could be here every time
But don't miss me goodness because I rub away every time
Then groan at the goodness but do you mean not every time?
Then gone in the goodness wish I could stay here every time"

A mistful meet with teachers speaking there muffled by buzzes and hums
So headphone tones do float me home, my chair was begging to come
And I'm not bummed, some works not fun then we crawl in the carpet like bugs

That should turn into something
You should turn into something

Unrestful eve, I sipped on leaks and sat in the room had a grudge
The jumping dust made catfish bust from corners now dripping with mud
And she knocked twice and we got silly and no-one knew what would come

She said, "Oh my sweet goodness, wish you could be here every time
But don't miss me goodness because I rub away every time
Then groan at the goodness but do you mean not every time?
Then gone in the goodness wish I could stay here every time"

But you'll turn into something
You should turn into something
