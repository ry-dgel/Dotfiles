Have you come to bust meYou still don't trust meSome things they will pass          
           Some things they must be

The troops are deserting
The backwater burning
Throw your boots in the fire
We won't be returning

Where where have you gone
My wide eyed Italian love song
When when will I learn
For this we all have been born
Are you with me
Are you still with me
Are you still with me
Or against me

Radio headquarters
We are approaching the border
Hide the contraband
Get your papers in order

Burn all that is useful
That's what we are reduced to
A life lies in repose
It's there if you choose to

Where where have you gone
My wide eyed Italian love song
When when will I learn
For this we all have been born
Are you with me
Are you still with me
Are you still with me
Or against me

Where where have you gone
My wide eyed Italian love song
When when will I learn
For this we all have been born
Are you with me
Are you still with me
Are you still with me
Or against me
