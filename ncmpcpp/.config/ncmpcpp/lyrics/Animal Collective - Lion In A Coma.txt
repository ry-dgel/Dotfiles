When all this mess will get me down I will depart from Chinatown
Weaving in and out of line, the sidewalk's full of merchandise
My nervous tick has got to quit, my cheeks are chewed down to the bit
Up on the roof is still a riot, the hustling crowds still get me tired
I go up there and light a leaf and wish our turn was not so brief
I'm paler than a summer blouse that's packed inside a haunted house
I pack my bags and feel the family here is cropped by many hands
That dig and plant me for the spring, come dig me out my lucid brain

This wilderness up in my head
This wilderness up in my head
This wilderness needs to get right out of my clothes and get into my bedroom

Is there no reason it can't be the way it was, music and me?
My three best friends so casually just letting go so joyfully
But if I let my wrist get tired, but if I let my spirit cry out
There'll always be that fear of dying or is it just trying to divide?
It makes me think my purest dreams are not what they're supposed to be
I trick myself when it is hard, I've got to keep up, oh my god
And hope that I will not be wrong and keep my faith inside a song
I'm blooming but my roots remind me not to leave them back in time

This wilderness up in my head
This wilderness up in my head
This wilderness needs to get right out of my clothes and get into my bedroom

Lion in a coma

Sometimes the sun will shine unless I am just feeling fine
Sometimes I'm not aware where I am or what I care
Sometimes I'm well to do but I don't know what to do
Sometimes I don't agree with my thoughts on being free

Please don't leave me, things that feel good
I've been lucky, trying to feel good

Sometimes the sun will shine unless I am just feeling fine
Sometimes I'm not aware where I am or what I care
Sometimes I'm well to do but I don't know what to do
Sometimes I don't agree with my thoughts on being free

Please don't leave me, things that feel good
I've been lucky, trying to feel good

Lion in a coma, lion in a coma
Who wants to smell the fine aroma
Lion in a coma, lion in a coma
Who wants to run but cannot roam, a
Lion in a coma, lion in a coma
Who wants to use his aching bones, a
Lion in a coma, lion in a coma
Don't keep the lion in a coma
Lion in a coma, lion in a coma
Who wants to smell the fine aroma
Lion in a coma, lion in a coma
Who wants to use his aching bones, a
Lion in a coma, lion in a coma
Who wants to run but cannot roam, a
Lion in a coma, lion in a coma
Don't keep the lion in a coma
