Willie sweet Willie where did you go
Riding 'round the town on a drunken spree
If I did you wrong won't you let me know?
And if I did you good then have a drink on me

Well, I've known you baby since you was a child
Your hair all curly and your eyes a dream
You know your kisses still drive me wild
Why d'you gotta treat me, oh, so mean?

Willie, sweet Willie, where did you go?
Riding 'round the town on a drunken spree
If I did you wrong won't you let me know?
And if I did you good then have a drink on me

So why you gotta go and be, oh, so coy?
Burning down the town in that limousine
I know you been flirting with the other boys
But if you come back home I'll treat you like a king

Willie, sweet Willie, where did you go
Riding 'round the town on a drunken spree
If I did you wrong won't you let me know?
And if I did you good then have a drink on me

Willie, sweet Willie, where did you go?
Riding 'round the town on a drunken spree
If I did you wrong won't you let me know?
And if I did you good then bring it back to me
