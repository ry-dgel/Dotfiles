I got a number on me 
I got a number 
Won't make it through the high noon sun 
I am my father's son 
I am my father's son 
His bed is made 
I was a hero 
Early in the morning 
I ain't no hero 
In the night 
I am my father's son 
And I'll build a house inside of you 
I'll go in through the mouth 
I'll draw three figures on your heart 
One of them will be me as a boy 
One of them will be me 
One of them will be me watching you run 
watching you run 
Into the high noon sun 
Watching you run 
Farther than guns will go 
You are a runner 
With a stolen voice 
And you are a runner 
And I am my father's son 
I am my father's son 
I am my father's son
