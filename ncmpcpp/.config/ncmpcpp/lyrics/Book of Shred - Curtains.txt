Like the light was all I had
I struck the book with my last match
The candle burned so soft and slow
I felt the warmth and felt its glow

Salt tasting tears
They roll off of my lips
One for each day I'm inside this house, it's a trap
One I can't quite escape so pretend it's the place that I love

Won't let it pass me by again
Won't let it pass me by again

The grass was clipped
The summer sun
Was beating down on my front yard
All the boys and girls would laugh
I'd watch them through the curtain's crack

Place all your bets and watch me lose
The life that I got but never used
Dream every night that one will come true
But only bad ones ever do

Won't let it pass me by again
Won't let it pass me by again

My heart beats way too fast
To let regret sit in my lap

Won't let it pass me by again
Won't let it pass me by again

(Won't let this pass me by again)
Won't let it pass me by again
(Won't let this pass me by again)
Won't let it pass me by again
