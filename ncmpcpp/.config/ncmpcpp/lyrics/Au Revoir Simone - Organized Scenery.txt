Trees grew leaves in the weeks I was gone
No response when the neighbours came to call
And you wouldn't want it any other way
We know everything changed

Remember
Sometimes summer wears away
When we want to see the sky
When you look down
You'll see, you'll find

In the warmth of the winter we cried out
"take what's left of your time and decide"
And you wouldn't look beyond the other way
We know everything changed

See how we watch the world go by when we wander
We even let all our plants die, don't think about them
Oh seeking can be so time consuming

Trees grew leaves in the weeks i was gone
Hands turn keys to the locks in the door
And we wouldn't want it any other way
We know everything changed
