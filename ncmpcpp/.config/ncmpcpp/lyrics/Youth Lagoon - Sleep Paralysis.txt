Through the house, walking fast
Stranger, tell me, I don't really
See what I, am seeing now
The body that escaped from the lake where she drowned

Killer kiss, kiss that takes
The breath away from every evil
You have made, a grave mistake
And sleep paralysis is showing me what it is.

Let it be on into space, I want
Planted in my brain I'll wait for you to come home
Darkest space are to you, as it is to me
Shepard I've been lost too many times to be free

Through the house, walking fast
Stranger, tell me, I don't really
See what I, am seeing now
The body that escaped from the lake where she drowned
