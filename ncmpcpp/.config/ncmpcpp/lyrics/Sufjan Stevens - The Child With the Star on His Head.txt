Positive Christmas energy, desperately seeking Santa, Take 3

Once in a while, you may think you see better than the others
Scrambling around in the dark with your drum
There is a time when young men must grow up and be brothers
Are you afraid of growing too fast?

And the child with the star on his head
All of the world rests on his shoulders
And the mother with the child on her breast
Blessed is she among women

And the trust we put in things
In small ideas, in engineering
The world of sports and second best
In consequences we will not put to rest

Why crawl around in the snow
When you know I am right here
Waiting for you to expect something more?

For I am warm, I am calling you close to my table
Where I have made us a feast 
For the year of troubles, they have gone
The winter brings a Christmas song

And the child with the star on his head
All of the world rests on his shoulders
And the mother with the child on her breast 
Blessed is she among women

Does all the world know better than
When Christmas comes the troubles end
The troubles end, the troubles end

And by the time thereâ€™s nothing left
An empty tree, a winter vest
A winter vest, a winter vest

And all the trust we put in things
In dictionaries, in engineering
In calendars, and television
In father's friends, in consequences
