I'm in a crisis
I need help
Come on mood shift, shift back to good again
Come on mood shift, shift back to good again
Come on be a friend

Nina Twin is trying to help, and I
Really hope that she succeeds
Though I picked the thorny path myself
I'm afraid, afraid of where it leads

Chemicals don't strangle my pen
Chemicals don't make me sick again
I'm always so dubious of your intent
Like I can't afford to replace what you've spent

Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!

Nina Twin is trying to help, and I
Really hope she gets me straight
Cause my own inner cosmology
Has become too dense to navigate

I'm in a crisis
I need help
Come on mood shift, shift back to good again
Come on mood shift, shift back to good again
Come on be a friend
Come on be a friend

Two, three, four
Chemicals don't flatten my mind
Chemicals don't mess me up this time
Know you bait me way more than you should
And it's just like you to hurt me when I'm feeling good

Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!

Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!
Come on chemicals!
