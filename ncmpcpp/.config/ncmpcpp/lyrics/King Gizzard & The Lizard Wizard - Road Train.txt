The spawn of Satan's back
t's made of steel and black
t comes to bring you pain
        
         
         It comes again and again
oad Train!
 
         

The spawn of Satan's here
It's come to bring you fear
It sets the road aflame
It comes to kill and maim
Road Train!

Lights that shine like bulging eyes
Keep on trucking through the night
The vortex opens through
Drive right in and straight through you

It's carting oil and drums
It's racing down the lane
With oily fiery rain
Road Train!

26 gears of petrol power
Keep on trucking hour by hour
One man is at the wheel
He's the dog at Satan's heel

Across the desert to the trees
Obliteration of the place
From the fire into the sea
Nonagon Infinity
Is coming!

The spawn of Satan speeds
The road beneath it bleeds
It comes to bring you shame
It comes again and again
Road Train!

Burning wheels of fiery red
Keep on trucking till we're dead
The beast is angry too
Drive real fast and eat up you

Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Is coming!

Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
