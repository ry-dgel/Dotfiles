Indochina, Capa jumps Jeep
Two feet creep up the road
To photo, to record
Meat lumps and war

They advance as does his chance
Very yellow white flash
A violent wrench grips mass
Rips light, tears limbs like rags

Burst so high
Finally Capa lands
Mine is a watery pit
Painless with immense distance

From medic from colleague
Friend, enemy, foe
Him five yards from his leg
From you, Taro

Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes

3:10 pm, Capa pends death
Quivers, last rattles, last chokes
All colours and cares glaze to grey
Shriveled and stricken to dots

The left hand grasps
What the body grasps not
Le photographe est mort
3.41415, alive no longer my amour

Faded for home May of '54
Doors open like arms my love
Painless with a great closeness
To Capa, to Capa

Capa dark after nothing
Re-united with his leg
And with you, Taro
Taro

Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes

Hey Taro!
