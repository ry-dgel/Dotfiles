Hot as a rail shot through the sun
Horizon awaits, stretch to become
Drifting in dream, sifting the real
Don't wait until the waters come
You reach into me, alchemical flood
Our wounds beat in time, slipstream begun
Claim what you need, through window surreal
Don't wait until the waters come
A vision in air, empire undone
No body below, now bodies of sun
Forever the drift, forever we run
Don't wait until the waters come
