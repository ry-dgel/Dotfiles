So now let me tell you about this girl of mine
Heart like all men's dreams in the days of '49
I turn hollow no me more swallow this fast only she breaks
But distance keeps her miles or meters what difference does it make

'Cause here they come again to repossess my dreams
Child don't play yourself, things are never what they seem
A bridge a river a pale moon sliver, city shines so bright
But to my despair I wake up where they sleep out every night

And the girl I love is oh, so far away
I wonder can she hear me as I go through my day

Oh, now the raging sea she laps upon my door
I'll round a thousand horns just to drown upon her shore
Blood red roses, go down Moses, oh billowing sails
Those so weak-willed guts all sea-filled thrown them o'er the rails

Boys tighten up the jib and sing a hearty song
We been driftin', driftin', for far too long
I take no care me I'm so bare-breasted on the bow
Scabbed and wheathered, skin of leather who's the deader now

But the girl I love is oh so, oh so far away
I wonder can she hear me as I go through my day
It's so long lady angel, I guess I'll say goodbye
But I do believe I'm aging right before your eyes

Wash up on her coast, not a nickel to my name
Sold my, sold my, sold my gold watch and chain
Enough to hire a band of liars to march me on my way
Through hills and valleys sugar ditch alleys up to her open gate

The girl I love is oh so, oh so far away
I wonder can she hear me as I go through my day
It's so long lady angel, I guess I'll say goodbye
But I do believe I'm aging right before your eyes

Cock crow in the morning, heard it loud and clear
Ask her for to marry, she answers with a tear
"Boy you have my heart and you know you always will
But that ain't enough to hold me 'cause love don't pay the bills."

I turned away in shame for all my days in vain
Guess I'll just drag on, no one loves you till you're gone
Let the river be my guide, let the desert be my bride
Till my heart turns to steel, till I no longer feel

That the girl I love is oh so, oh so far away
I wonder can she hear me as I go through my day
It's so long lady angel, I guess I'll say goodbye
But I do believe I'm aging right before your eyes
