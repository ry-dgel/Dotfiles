I know you want it
I know you really wanna get it right
Have you forsaken?
Have you mistaken me for someone else?

You said I may not hide
You sleep with a rifle at your side
Delivering speeches
Delivering speeches left and right

Follow those created deaths
Fortune save me from his wrath
Spaceship at the house at night
Prophet, speak what's on your mind

You know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord

Visit the future
Visit the future from the outer space
A ring of fire
A ring of fire falling on your face

You dream of the dark age
You dream of the dark age of your youth
Consider the danger
Consider the danger as it moves

Prophet, royal priest, and king
(I know you want it, I know you really want to)
Snake-skinned master at your feet
(I know you want it, I know you really want to)
Barricade the bathroom doors
(I know you want it, I know you really want to)
Find some things you can't ignore
(I know you want it, I know you really want to)

I know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta

I know I've caused you trouble
I know I've caused you pain
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord

I know I've lost my conscience
I know I've lost all shame
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord

I know I've always loved you
I know I've always been
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord

Get real, get right
For you will not be distracted by the signs
Do not be distracted by them
Do yourself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord

Get real, get right
For you will not be distracted by the signs
Do not be distracted by them
Do yourself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord
Get real, get right with the Lord
