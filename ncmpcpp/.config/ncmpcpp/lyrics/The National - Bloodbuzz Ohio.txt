Stand up straight at the foot of your love, I
Lift my shirt up
Stand up straight at the foot of your love, I
Lift my shirt up

I was carried
To Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married
But Ohio don't remember me

Lay my head on the hood of your car, I
Take it too far
Lay my head on the hood of your car, I
Take it too far

I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe
The floors are falling out from everybody I know

I'm on a bloodbuzz, yes, I am
I'm on a bloodbuzz
I'm on a bloodbuzz, God, I am
I'm on a bloodbuzz

I was carried
To Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married
But Ohio don't remember me

I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe
The floors are falling out from everybody I know

I'm on a bloodbuzz, yes, I am
I'm on a bloodbuzz
I'm on a bloodbuzz, God, I am
I'm on a bloodbuzz
