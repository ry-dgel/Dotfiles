Well i went down in empty lane
earching for a song
ame back an empty man
         
           my whiskers they hung long
lord they hung long

and yes i am your native son
despite my queer disguise
i keep all i can call my own
in the bags beneath my eyes
underneath my eyes

well oh miss meri
don't despair we
we got ways
to numb your pain
same old story
blood sweat glory
just hope all your trials weren't in vain

to all my so called country men
blessed to stolen ground
is jesus gonna pick you up
when your hunger weighs you down
when it weighs you down

mama come and save me
nothin's sacred anymore
what good was livin' for
and i've been wondering
just who misplaced my soul
theres pockets in my holes

and way out on the open plain
men pave beneath the sun
the great suburban dawn
if you build it they will come
build it they will come
build it they will come

well oh miss meri
don't despair
we got ways
to numb your pain
same old story
blood sweat glory
just hope all your trials weren't in vain

but i went down in empty lane
searching for a song
came back an empty man
my whiskers they hung long
lord they hung long
lord they hung long
