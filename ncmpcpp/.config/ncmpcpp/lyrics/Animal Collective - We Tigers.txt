May I bang with this?

I'm like this... and you're like this (x4)

We tigers We tigers Woop!

Hey kids let's pick up sticks 
let's make out the sounds of our own,
All dogs invited if everything feels wrong then we need a little bangin' goin on.
1-2-3 arms for the trees 
self seekers vomiting doubts,
I changed all your words but my poltergeist concurs that words aren't even necessary right now.

But I'm a noisy singer, singing out at a dinner: dinners are much stranger now.

Everybody's lovin', Everybody's lovin' (x5)

Tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers
Ohh... Ahh...
Katydid, a katydid
Ohh... Ahh...
Ogres ogres ogres ogres ogres ogres...
Ohh... Ahh.... (x5)

I've felt worse
I feel the curse of knowing what I shouldn't be, (I like it)
I don't know where we'll go but lets walk around and pretend we're everything we see,
Kiss for a kiss, love change for chips, rules; but I thought you and I,
Remember the young duck you crashed at my apartment you kept me up and made me smile.

Now I'm a noisy singer, singing out at a dinner: dinners are much stranger now.

Everybody's lovin', Everybody's lovin' (x5)

Tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers
Tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers
Tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers
Tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers tigers
Tigers!
