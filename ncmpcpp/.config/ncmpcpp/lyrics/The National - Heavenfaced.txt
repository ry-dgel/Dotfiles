I could walk out but I won't
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can't face heaven all heavenfaced

No one's careful all the time
If you lose me I'm gonna die

How completely high was I?
I was off by a thousand miles
Hit the ceiling then you fall
Things are tougher than we are

I could walk out but I won't
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can't face heaven all heavenfaced

Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love

She's a griever and I believe her
It's not a fever, it's a freezer
I believe her and I'm a griever now
She's a griever and I believe her
It's not a fever, it's a freezer
I believe her and I'm a griever now

Because we'll all arrive in heaven alive
We'll all arrive
Because we'll all arrive in heaven alive
We'll all arrive
