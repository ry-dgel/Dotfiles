And after the storm
I run and run as the rains come
And I look up, I look up
On my knees and out of luck
I look up

Night has always pushed up day
You must know life to see decay
But I won't rot, I won't rot
Not this mind and not this heart
I won't rot

And I took you by the hand
And we stood tall
And remembered our own land
What we lived for

But there will come a time, you'll see
With no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears

Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart and flowers
In your hair

And now I cling to what I knew
I saw exactly what was true
But oh no more
That's why I hold
That's why I hold with all I have
That's why I hold

And I will die alone and be left there
Well I guess I'll just go home
Or God knows where
Because death is just so full and man so small
Well I'm scared of what's behind
And what's before

But there will come a time, you'll see
With no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears

Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart and flowers
In your hair

And there will come a time, you'll see
With no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears

Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart and flowers
In your hair
