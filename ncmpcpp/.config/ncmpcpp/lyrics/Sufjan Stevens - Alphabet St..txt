I'm going down to Alphabet Street
I'm gonna crown the first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head to my feet
(Yeah, she will)

I'm gonna drive my daddy's Thunderbird
A white rad ride, '66 ('67) so glam it's absurd
I'm gonna put her in the back seat
And drive her to Tennessee

Excuse me, baby
I don't mean to be rude
I guess tonight I'm just not, just not in the mood
So if you don't mind, I would like to watch, can I?

I'm going down, down, down if that's the only way
To make this cruel, cruel world hear what we've got to say
Put the right letters together and make a better day
Baby it's the only way
