The wind has gone, the invisible come
Your memories are being run
The mountain scarred by invisible bars
The stillness is on guard

Oh, the wind will come, blow answer, echo's answer

The mountain mine from invisible time
I am next in line
The message sent was of discontent
From incline to incline

Oh, the wind will come, blow answer, echo's answer

The wind is near, the invisible hear
Come my thoughts away from fear

Oh, the wind has come, blow answer, all these echo's
