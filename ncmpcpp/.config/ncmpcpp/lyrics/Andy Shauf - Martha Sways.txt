Martha stands
Pretty just like you
I held her close
Like i held you

Martha sways
And i follow suit
She fills my glass
And i toss it back
Into the space that once held you

And dance dance to the radio
While the devil takes control
Dance dance to the radio
While the devil takes control

There's a weight
Holding me down
Martha says
It's all in my head
I look at the lights
Dancing in her eyes
And i wanna die
Dancing in her eyes

Dance dance to the radio
While the devil takes control
Dance dance to the radio
While the devil takes control
Dance dance to the radio
While the devil takes control
Dance dance to the radio
While the devil takes control

Martha spins
And i catch her hand
She smiles and laughs
Bringing me back
