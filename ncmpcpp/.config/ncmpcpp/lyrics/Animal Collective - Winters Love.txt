I love this light in winter time,
Those frost cakes in the carpet
in winter time I have no legs
just stumps of meat below me
No falls snowfalls could ruin my day
It's masked up from the street wire
and winter's glow where could she be
She's warmin' in my my pocket
Just a calm and modern day
In early, early morning
Rush to her, and rush to him,
Am I a better person?
even in the whole take on
the loss is better said
I pulled the boy out of a box
She made that boy a man
