Sweet friend of mine
Where can we find the dancing sun?
Oh, last night was fun, like the rest going by
My youth and I

Still don't know what you're waiting for
But you don't wanna be left alone
Oh, lonely days
Escape the world we're waiting for
Get a good game, going back from the rising water

(Come along, come along, come along)

So come along with me
'Til we're breaking free
'Cause I can't stop following dreams
We'll rise in waves and waters
In the sea, you will carry me

So come along with me
'Til we're breaking free
In stormy nights, we can be free
I'll dive into the sky
In the sea, you will wait for me

Sweet friend of mine
My blood's on fire, so hold me tight
The dust closing in is leaving us blind
My love and I

Still don't know what you're waiting for
But you don't wanna be left alone
Oh, lonely days
Escape the world we're waiting for
Get a good game, going back from the rising water

(Come along, come along, come along)

So come along with me
'Til we're breaking free
'Cause I can't stop following dreams
Our longing days are over
In the sea, we were meant to be

So come along with me
'Til we're breaking free
In stormy nights, we can be free
I'll dive into the sky
In the sea, you belong to me

(Come along, come along, come along)
So come along with me

Oh, carry me, carry me home [x4]
