It's the way that your kiss condemns me
It makes me feel like I'm in Guantanamo
Iodine where your fingertips tore me
You treated me like a feral animal

Poor Percy rotting in the Amazon
A doomed man lost in limbo
Has a better chance in Hell than I do
Of keeping cool

Too uncouth for you
From the udder to the mouth
We're all biding our time 
From the uterus to the ground

And our hearts are cunning
(Like a lizard in the sun)
When they want something
(Like poison, pink wonton)
Throw you under a bus
Grind your teeth to dust
You hide in the dark
And you suck your thumb

I shave my head as you bury all your baggage
In the bed of another dumb cock-smith
I don't sleep just to dull my memories
Of how you love like an overseer's horsewhip

Waterboard me with "Call Me Maybe"
Looping on an endless repeat
Ain't got nothing on the kiss you gave me
So cruel so sweet

Too uncouth for you
From the udder to the mouth
We're all biding our time
From the uterus to the ground

And our hearts are cunning
(Like a lizard in the sun)
When they want something
(Like poison, pink wonton)
Throw you under a bus
Grind your teeth to dust
You hide in the dark and you suck your
(Bang, Bang, Pow)
(Bang, you're dead)

Ooh, what's your popo making?
Ooh, what's your popo making?
Ooh, what's your popo making?

Ooh, what's your popo making?
Ooh, what's your popo making?
Ooh, what's your popo making?
(Pink Wonton)

Ooh, what's your popo making?
Ooh, what's your popo making?
Ooh, what's your popo making?

And our hearts are cunning
(Like a lizard in the sun)
When they want something
(Like poison, Pink Wonton)
And our hearts are cunning
(Way easier, in the sun)
Throw you under a bus
Grind your teeth to dust
You hide in the dark and you suck your thumb
