And I don’t know just what I got myself into and all I know is I can’t let go
And I don’t know just what I got myself into, all I know is I can’t let go

This chain won't break, ooh, this chain won't break
Ooh, this chain won't break because of you

And I don’t know just what I got myself into and all I know is I can’t let go
And I don’t know just what I got myself in to, all I know is I can’t let go, yeah
And all the faces, all these faces, well, they look same
And all the faces, all these faces, well, they look same
And all the faces, all these faces, well, they look same
And all the faces, all these faces, well, they look same

This chain won't break, ooh, this chain won't break
Ooh, this chain won't break because of you
