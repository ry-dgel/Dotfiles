Who'll be my Valentine?
Who'll lift this heavy load? 
Who'll share this taxicab?
Who wants to climb aboard?

Who is an honest man?
Who is an honest man?

Who'll help a tired soldier
Far from his own hometown?
Carry these men and women
Who get lost when the sun goes down?

Who is an honest man?
Who is an honest man?

Who walks this dusty road?
Who always pulls their weight?
Who's this inside-a me?
Who made a big mistake?

Who sees these constellations?
See them go spinning round
Carry these men and women
Who get lost when the sun goes down?

Who is an honest man?
Who is an honest man?

With a graceful motion she sat down slowly
Drank a cup of coffee and she'll fold her laundry
She begins to tell us all her life story
All around the table, ev'rybody starin'

Who shouts out "hallelujah"?
Who's gonna sing out loud?
Carry these men and women
Who get lost when the sun goes down?

Who's getting out-a here?
Who thinks they're wide awake?
Who's gonna be my friend?
All around the table, ev'rybody starin'
