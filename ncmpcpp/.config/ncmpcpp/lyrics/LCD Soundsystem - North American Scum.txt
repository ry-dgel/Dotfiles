Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are North Americans
And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no

We build our planes and our trains till we think we might die
Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
Uh-huh, oh, oh

I hate the feelin' when you're looking at me that way
'Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay
Makes it go away

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're North American
But in the end we make the same mistakes all over again
Come on, North Americans

Oh, we are North American scum
Oa, we're from North America

And all the kids, all the kids, that want to make a scene
Here in North America
When our young kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those

So where's the love, where's the love, where's the love, where's the love
Where's the love tonight?
But there's no love man, there's no love and the kids are uptight
Uh, uh

So throw a party till the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go, North Americans
Oh, you were planning it I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry

I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in North America
But then I said the more I do it, the better it gets
Let's rock, North America

Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we're from North America
Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we are North American

New York's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo, North America
And it's the furthest you can live from the government
Uh-huh, huh

Some fat American Christians might disagree
Here in North America
But New York's the only place we keep them off the street
Boo, boo

Now we can't have parties like in Spain where they go all night
Shut down in North America
Or like Berlin where they go another night, alright
Uh-huh, uh-huh

You see I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, North America
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'Cause we're North Americans

Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we're are North Americans
Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we love North America

Take me back to the states, man
North American scum
Where we can be in any one of million new bands
North American

Where the DJ gigs aren't as fun
Here in North American scum
But don't blame the Canadians
Look out North America
