I know just what you are
It's not a bowl of ice cream
It's not a conflict diamond
Or a double scoop of saline

I know just what you want
Its what we all desire
It's not a foxy lover 
Or the call of higher powers

I smash my crystal ball
I burn my tarot cards 
'Cause I can't hit the notes I used to

Pyramids of money silhouetting in your dreams
Pyramids of money that you'll probably never see, It's true

I don't need no PhD to show me that my flaws run deep
We'll burn our merit badges at night
I don't need no E.M.T. to show me how my heart should be
We'll earn our merit badges at night

I know just what you are
It's not a Burmese pony
It's not a dying death wish 
Or a child that's raised by Kony
I know just what you want
It's what we all desire
It's not a call for peace 
Or knocking down the Ivory towers

I smash my crystal ball
I burn my tarot cards, cause
I can't hit the notes I used to
I can't hit the notes I want to

Pyramids of money silhouetting in your dreams
Pyramids of money pirouetting in your dreams
Pyramids of money that you'll probably never see, It's true

I know just what you are
It's not a bowl of ice cream 
It's not a conflict diamond (I know just what you are)
Or a double scoop of saline
I know just what you want
It's what we all desire (I know just what you are)
It's not a foxy lover
Or the call of higher powers

I smash my crystal ball
I burn my tarot cards

I know just what you are
It's not a Burmese pony (I know just what you are)
It's not a dying death wish
Or a child that's raised by Kony

I know just what you want
It's what we all desire (I know just what you want)
It's not a call for peace or knocking down the Ivory towers

I smash my crystal ball (I know just what you are)
I burn my tarot cards (I know just what you are)

I know just what you are
I know just what you are
I know just what you are
I know just what you are
