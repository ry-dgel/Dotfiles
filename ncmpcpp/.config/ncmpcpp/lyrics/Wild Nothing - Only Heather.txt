Dressed in the moonlight and paler than bone
She has got something that I've never known
I couldn't explain it I won't even try
She is so lovely she makes me feel high

Cause I'm with Heather
Yeah only Heather
Can make me feel this way

Misunderstood she's good I can tell
Though everyone tells me I'm under her spell
But I'll never leave her they don't know our deal
Its better to fake than to love her for real

Cause I'm with Heather
Yeah only Heather
Can make me feel this way
