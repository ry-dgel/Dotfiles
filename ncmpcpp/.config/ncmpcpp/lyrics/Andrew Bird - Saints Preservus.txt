I once was found
But now I'm lost
I could be anywhere
Where the strip malls are beige
And the asphalt is hot
Bring me your poor
And your trembling masses
Bring them here
To shelter in your soft-structured parking lot

I'm a stranger
In a land that's anything but strange
Bury me standing
Bury me deep
Beneath the pylons

I'm groping in the dark
My arms stretched out before me
Saints, preserve us
Beneath your cracks and fissures
Among the fossiled fishes
Our souls, our souls to keep

I'm a stranger
In a land that's anything but strange
Bury me standing
Oh, bury me deep
Beneath the pylons

I'm groping in the dark
My arms stretched out before me
Saints, preserve us
Beneath your cracks and fissures
Among the fossiled fishes
Our souls, our souls to keep
