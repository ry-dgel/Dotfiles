hey man whats your problem
don't you know that I don't belong to you
it's hard and hard enough
to keep it up when everything is so new

I'm not trying to forget you
I just like to be alone
come and give me the space I need
and you may and you may and you may
find that were alright
I'm not trying to forget you
I just like to be my own
come and give me the space I need
and you may and you may and you may
find that we're alright

I mean no offense to you
but grow up
cant you just grow up?
when are you going to
give it your own go?
give it your own go
I know I'm being way too hard
but I know that I'm trying

I know myself
and I know what I want to do
I'm doing my best
and I want to know
is it good for you?
you give me trouble
you give me everything that you've got
I'll show you that
whats right for you me
isn't for you

don't look out for me

who are you to tell me how
when you've problems of your own
I do love you and
I want to hold on to you for always
