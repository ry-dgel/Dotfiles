And ??? not my hand, not mine
ou think you're good until you watch them faint
ou're passing time right over here
         
           Inside, inside
Who's stalking, who's crouching?
Your glassy words lie so bright
Inside, inside

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Can't save both and it's not

Oh it's all in my mind
Can't stay more than ???
Coming in ??? and it's not my hand
You shake your demons think so much we'll never meet
Your kind ??? all I left here
Inside, inside

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Can't save both and it's not
Oh it's all in my mind

Who's stalking, who's crouching?
Your glassy words lie so bright
Inside, inside
But I don't wanna chase it, silently
But I don't wanna chase it, silently
But I don't wanna chase it, silently
