This is as accurate as I can get this. The identified lines will likely need corrections and some others as well1
It may be hard
to say its all over
You make it hard
to frame the right cover
You're taking off ?
we'll take you no further ?
You take up all the brains ?
and start over ?When all at once we say ?
"to move on" we should
And all the promises
that were made were good ?Anyway you want to say
it was only a fear
that we're praying on
Anyway you want to say
it was only a tear
that we're waiting on dear2
When all you wants to say ?
you're not there
That's not to say
the neighbors wont care
It only works to play
the right player ?
When all that hurts ?
to say you wont say it ?When all at once we say ?
"to move on" we should
And all the promises
that were made were good
Anyway you want to say
it was only a fear
that we're praying on
Anyway you want to say
it was only a tear
that we're waiting on dearAnyway you want to say
it was only a fear
that we're praying on
Anyway you want to say
it was only a tear
that we're waiting on dear
