Walking through the trees
I never really know what's on your mind
Is it ever me, or just someone you've left behind?
Floating through a dream,
I never could make out the words you said
Sentences are bouncing back and forth
Inside my head
You don't have to leave
You could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police
We could find comfort in debauchery
Fighting through the fog
I can't believe it rained all summer long
When every day's a hurricane,
you know there's something wrong
I see you every day
It's hard to figure out what happens next
I cannot decipher conversation in your head
You don't have to leave
You could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police
We could find comfort in debauchery
You don't have to leave
You could just stay here with me
Forget all the local police
We could find comfort in biology
We wrote our names on the overpass,
And I hope it lasts
Forever
Don't have to, you don't have to
You don't have to leave,
You could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police
We could find comfort in debauchery
You don't have to leave,
You could just stay here with me
Forget all the local police
We could find-
If you don't want to, you don't have to
