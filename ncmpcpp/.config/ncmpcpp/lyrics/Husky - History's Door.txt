Two hearts burning on a hillside turning
Round the blazing sun, fever burning
In her head that's turning round the things she's done
Free your heart, that is the hardest part
He says, "Your heart won't lie"

Find your hope forget your home
Heed that feeling in your bones
For your heart knows you'll never win
Until you're free from him

Don't look back, there is no use in wondering
Just how or why if you leave now
You might just make it home before the morning light
Tired and poor, you kneel at history's door tonight

Find your hope, forget your home
Heed that feeling in your bones
For your heart knows you'll never win
Until you're free from him

Find your hope, forget your home
Heed that feeling in your bones
For your heart knows you'll never win
Until you're free from him, woo ah oh

Find your hope, forget your home
Heed that feeling in your bones
For your heart knows you'll never win
Until you're free from him

Find your hope, forget your home
Heed that feeling in your bones
For your heart knows you'll never win
Until you're free from him, woo ah oh
