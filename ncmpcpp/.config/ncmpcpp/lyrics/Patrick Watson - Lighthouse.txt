Leave a light on in the wild,
Cause I'm coming in
A little blind
Dreaming of a lighthouse in the woods
Shining a little light to bring us back home

When to find you in the backyard,
Hiding behind all busy lives
Dreaming of a light house in the woods
To help us get back into the world

Cause I know
I've seen you before
Won't you shine
A little light
On us now

Won't you shine a little light
In your own backyard
Won't you shine a little light
In your own backyard

Dreaming of a lighthouse in the woods
