If only there could be another way to do this
'Cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
I know I always said that I could never hurt you
Well this is the very, very last time I'm ever going to

But I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
Said, I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too eventually, eventually

Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
'Cause if I was never in your life, you wouldn't have to change this

But I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
Said, I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too eventually, eventually
And I know just what I've got to do and it's got to be soon
'Cause I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too eventually, eventually
Eventually, eventually, eventually, eventually, eventually, eventually
