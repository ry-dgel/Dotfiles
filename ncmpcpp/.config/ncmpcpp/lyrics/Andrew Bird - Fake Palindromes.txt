my dewy-eyed Disney bride what has tried
wapping your blood with formaldehyde?
onsters?
         
           
Whiskey-plied voices cried fratricide!
Jesus don't you know that you coulda died
with the monsters what talk
monsters what walk the earth

she's got red lipstick
and a bright pair of shoes
knee high socks
what to cover a bruise
she's got an old death kit
she's been meaning to use
blood in her eyes in her eyes for you
she's got blood in her eyes for you

certain fads, stripes and plaids singles ads
run you hot and cold like a rheostat I mean a thermostat
so you bite on a towel
hope it won't hurt too bad

she says I like long walks and sci-fi movies
you're six foot tall and east coast bred
some lonely night we can get together
and I'm gonna tie your wrists with leather
and drill a tiny hole into your head
