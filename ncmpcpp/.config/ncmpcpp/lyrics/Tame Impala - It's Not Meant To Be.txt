I wanted her, I wanted her
But she doesn't like the life that I lead
She doesn't like the life that I lead
Doesn't like sand stuck on her feet
Or sitting around smoking weed
I must seem more like a friend in need

And I boast that it is meant to be
But in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

And she doesn't like the friends that I make
Doesn't make friends for friendship's sake
She just gets bored sitting by the lake
Her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache

And I boast that it is meant to be
But in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

And I thought they could cure his disease
But in all honesty he didn't have a hope in hell
Now we'll never see him move
