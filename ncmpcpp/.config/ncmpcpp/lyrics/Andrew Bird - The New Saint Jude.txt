Come on, all you stand-up men
You self-empowered beginners
And all your lucky ladies
To whom you write your letters

I keep moving through my days
As if I had never met her
But ever since I, I gave up hope
I've been feeling so much better
Yeah I'm feelin' so much better
But ever since I gave up hope
I've been feelin' so much better

So here's a mighty revelation
That's sure to cure what ails ya
That everyone's just a disappointment
And everyone's a failure

And this we shall celebrate
In our finest regalia
Like a choir of shining angels
A congregation of Mahalias

I'm feelin' so much better
Ever since I thought I gave up hope
I've been feeling so much better

You hear that bell now
You hear it ringing
You hear it ringing
The bells of St. Jude

So fill your lungs now
'Cause we'll be singin'
We'll be singin'
We love you, St. Jude
We'll be singin'
We love you, St. Jude

Feelin' so much better
Feelin' so much better
Feelin' so much better
Feelin' so much better
