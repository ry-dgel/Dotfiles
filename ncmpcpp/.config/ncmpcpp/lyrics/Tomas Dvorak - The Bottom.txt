Science!

Beaten, brought in,
I've gotten to the bottom

Sixteen, full of fright
Got brought in from the night
She is whispering in my ear
All of my greatest fears, she said:

"Beaten, brought in,
I've gotten to the bottom"

I call her name inside the park
She can't see me, its too dark

I found out just why she whispered
At me, the microphone's sayin':

"Beaten, brought in,
I've gotten to the bottom"

Science!

Beaten, brought in,
I've gotten to the bottom [x8]
