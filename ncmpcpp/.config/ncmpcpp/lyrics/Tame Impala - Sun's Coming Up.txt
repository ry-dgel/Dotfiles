All those things I ever thought
Would never end
To think they're now all memories
Sends me round the bend

To watch her airplane swaying
Coming in to land
There my world is hanging
In someone else's hands

And if I have done something
And you have to let me go
Think of me as someone
Someone that you know

But if I don't hear something
Pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect completely
See how that works out

I wasn't daring
Not much a chancer
Oh my darling
Why won't you answer?

7:00 AM
Midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now
I guess it's over

Playing his guitar
He's dying of cancer
Oh my father
Why won't you answer?

7:00 AM
Midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now
I guess it's over
