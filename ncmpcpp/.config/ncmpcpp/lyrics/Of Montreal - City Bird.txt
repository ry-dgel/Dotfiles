City bird, haven't you heard?
Hasn't anybody told you?
The city blocks can't hold you
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you?

City bird, haven't you heard
of the boundlessness of your freedom?
The sky is your blue kingdom
You neglect your wings like you don't need them

City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
Maybe you understand that, city bird

City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
Maybe you understand that, city bird

City bird, haven't you heard?
Hasn't anybody told you?
The city blocks can't hold you
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you?
