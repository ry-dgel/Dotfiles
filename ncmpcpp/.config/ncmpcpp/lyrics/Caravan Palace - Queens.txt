It's place called Queens,
but nobody's looking for trouble.
I'm gonna beat them all
in a world where I've never been.(Indistinguishable/Unknown)
Thank God there's none.
(Indistinguishable/Unknown)
They sell their soul.In search of twigs,
My body's cold as I amble.
I'm gonna beat them all
facing worlds that I've never seen.(Indistinguishable/Unknown)
Thank God there's none.
(Indistinguishable/Unknown)
They sell their soul.
