There's a funny lightning
hreatening with striking
ut it moves too quick for a picture
         
           
There's a funny lightning
'round the corner hiding
but I'm too smart just to catch it
with gloves and rubber

So I stay put right here
watching the sky for tears
let the fools and cowboys roar to wrecks

But if I should wake up and find my home's in half
Who is it ? blame nature, I guess I have to laugh
and if I should wake up and find my bed has moved
six inches, six closer to the west

But this funny lightning
I wanna invite in
if I could learn how to teach it

I salt the corners of
my room because, because
a ghost can never be too careful

And if I should wake up and find my home's in half ?
Who did it? oh nature, I hope you have a laugh
and if I should wake up and find my bed has moved
twelve inches, twelve closer to my god

Whip crash there's a flash and I'm back to wanting more
the crack is movin' up the wall
whip crash there's flash and I'm back to wanting more
I can't help thinking this is war

Whip crash there's a flash and I'm back to wanting more
the crack is movin' up the wall
whip crash there's flash and I'm back to wanting more
I can't help thinking this is war
