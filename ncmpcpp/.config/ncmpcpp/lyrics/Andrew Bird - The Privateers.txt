Don't sell me anything 
Your one time offer, so uncalled-for 
You call it peace of mind 

Cause I can see your house from here 
Now all the leaves have fallen, dear 
I can see you're just a little privateer 
As your confession draws more near 

Time and again, I find I'm listless 
Or rather, fistless 
In time, oh, that's what I find 

So carry me to Mecca 
With what you may divine 
Take me with you, take me with you 
Don't leave me behind 

Oh cause I, I don't want your life insurance 
Home, auto, health, flood, and fire insurance 
Oh, just make, please make this basic inference 
And speak of me in the present tense 

Oh cause I, I can see your ships from here 
Now all the weather's so bright and clear 
I can see you're just a little profiteer 
As your confession draws more near 

As your confession draws more near 

As your confession draws more near
