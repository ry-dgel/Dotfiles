She's a primitive girl
She says it herself
She cuts to the chase
Yeah like nobody else

If you say how're you doing
She'll say I'm doing well
She's a primitive girl
She says it herself

She's a primitive girl
She don't like to boast
From her natural head
to her natural toes
The girl's got a lot
Of what they call the most
Yeah she's a primitive girl
But she don't like to boast

And I'd like to think
I'm a primitive guy
I see the difference
The difference between
What I want, what I need
And a primitive girl
She don't need me
No, she don't need me

She's a primitive girl
She's setting me free

She's nobody's fool
I know she never was for me
She's a primitive girl
She's setting me free
