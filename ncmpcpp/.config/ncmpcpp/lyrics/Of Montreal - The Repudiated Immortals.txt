The creator of what's now clich√© had some funny words to say
îall you little things are incomplete¬î
hy did he speak of us that way?
         
           I don't cry not 'cause I don't care
It's very hard to feel the way we used to feel up there
The creator of what's now clich√©
Wants us little things to cry and feel alone

But don't don't lose hope no no no no
No no no don't feel sad 'cause it's a violent world
But there's still beauty
I'll take care of you if you take care of me

I like to sit and listen to the sound
Of the snowflakes landing on the trees
But I can't get used to feeling cold
I can't get used to what has happened here to you and me
There's no escaping so I won't try
It's just the heaviness that comes with knowing you will never die
