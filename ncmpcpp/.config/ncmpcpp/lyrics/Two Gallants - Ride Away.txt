As I went up the hill
To see the sisters three
The only words that they could say
Were "Soon they'll come for thee"

As I went to the square
To see my brothers hang
The only words they could say
Were "Till we meet again"

Ride away, ride away
Baby we will ride
Rest upon my shoulder
Until the morning light

As I went to the church
To let my soul be stilled
The only words that I could hear
Came echoing off the hills

Ride away, ride away
Baby we will ride
Sleep upon my should 
While the bullets 'round us fly
Far away, far away
Way out past the world

Ride away, ride away
Baby we will ride
Sleep upon my shoulder
With a bullet in your side
Far away, far away
Way out past the world.
