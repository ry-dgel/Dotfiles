When the time comes, move with the season
Lend your young ear to the sound of day
When the time comes, move with the season
Lend your young ear to the sound of day

When the time comes, move with the seasons
Bend your young ears to the sound of day
When the time comes, move with the feelin'
Lend your ear to the sound of day

In our place there's a sun stretched
The sunlight on our minds
Bringing life to the side
Waiting on to slight the find

...
Take with this one be on the
Think of only things, secrets on lifetime

When the time comes, move with the seasons
Bend your young ears to the sound of day
When the time comes, move with the feelin'
Lend your ear to the sound of day

...
Save the memory of the star
