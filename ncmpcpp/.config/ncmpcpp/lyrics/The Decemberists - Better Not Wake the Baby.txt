Kick a hole in the hallway wall
Singing like a painted lady
Use your skull like a cannonball
But it better not wake the baby

How long will this go on?
How long, indeed?
Bang your drum till the money's all gone
But it better not wake the baby

Make your moan of your lot in life
Split your mind half crazy
Gouge your eyes with a butter knife
But it better not wake the baby

How long will this go on?
How long, indeed?
Bang your drum till the money's all gone
But it better not wake the baby

Drown yourself in crocodile tears
Curse the god what made ye
Pine away for your banner years
But it better not wake the baby

How long will this go on?
How long, indeed?
Bang your drum till the money's all gone
But it better not wake the baby

How long will this go on?
How long, indeed?
Bang your drum till the money's all gone
But it better not wake the 
Better not wake the
Better not wake the baby
