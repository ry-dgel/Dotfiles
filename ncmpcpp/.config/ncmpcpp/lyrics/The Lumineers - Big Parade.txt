Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see

Fleet of black, fleet of black limousines
These tinted machines, here comes the cavalcade

With the armored cars, armored cars like berettas
Flags on antennaes designed to keep me safe, keep me safe

And oh my my oh hey hey
Here he comes, the candidate
Blue eyed boy, united states
Vote for him, the candidate

Diamonds cut, diamonds cut for the carats
Plaster of paris, the floats fill up the street

And the beauty queens, beauty queens with the white gloves
All sick from the night clubs, they wave with pageantry, pageantry

Oh my my oh hey hey
Here it comes, the big parade
Marching bands and barricades
Make way, for the big parade

Canvas covered, canvas covered in resin
The violent men who dance the blood ballet
And the bookies say, bookies say it's the 3rd round
Oh when louie will go down, if he don't there's hell to pay, and hell to raise

And oh my my oh hey hey
Here he comes, the welterweight
Take a dive, for goodness sake
Or say goodbye to the welterweight

Catholic priest, catholic priest in a crisis
He's torn between romance and jesus, who will win the civil war

And he says I'm in love, I'm in love with a woman
Yea this is my confession, I'm leaving I can't a priest anymore, anymore

And oh my my oh hey hey
There he goes, the man of faith

Left the church for a fiance
Let him love, the man of faith

TV cameras, TV cameras and stage hands
American bandstand, electric guitars

And he's singin songs, singin songs for the lonely
All the girls with the room keys, they know all his words by heart, by heart and they all sing
Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see

Lovely girl won't you stay, oh oh ohoh

Oh my my oh hey hey
Here she comes by saving grace
Burn the car and save the plates
She's arrived, my saving grace
