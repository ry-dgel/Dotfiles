Of all the churning random hearts under the sun
Eventually fading into night
These two are opening now
As we lie I touch you under fuller light

Girl, if you're a seascape, I'm a listing boat
For the thing carries every hope, I invest in a single lie
The choice is yours to be loved
Come away from an emptier boat

'Cause when the dead moon rises again
Be no time to stall or protocol to hem us in
And when the dog slides underneath the train
There's no time, no use to searching for the mutt's remains

Throw all consequence aside
And a cheerless pyre we will set alight

Of all the intersecting lines in the sand
I routed a labyrinth to your lap
I never used a map, sliding off the land on an incidental tide
And along the way, you know they try, they try

We got sea legs and we're off tonight
Can't have that to which they've no right
You belong to a simpler time
I'm a victim to the impact of these words and this rhyme

And we got sea legs
And we're off tonight
Can't have that to which they've no right
You belong to a simpler time
I'm a victim to the impact of these words and this rhyme

'Cause when the dead moon rises again
Be no time to stall or protocol to hem us in
Darling, when the dog slides, open the door and where'd she go?
There's no time, no use to searching for the mutt's remains

Throw all consequence aside
And a cheerless pyre we will set alight
