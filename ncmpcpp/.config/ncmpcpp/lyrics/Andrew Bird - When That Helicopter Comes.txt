It's gonna rain champagne
And the hills are gonna dance
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

The sky will swim in lightning fire
And the trees will shake and scream
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

When the helicopters come
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

Rocks are gonna roll up hill
And the sun will dive in the sea
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

The dead are gonna wake and sing
And roll their bones in the grass
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

When the helicopters come
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come
