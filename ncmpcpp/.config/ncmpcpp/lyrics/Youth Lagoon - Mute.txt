Living in a 3-D world
Where the clock is in control
He sits on his throne on top of my wrist
And tells me what I know

The devil tries to plague my mind
But he can't quite get inside
I'll place my jar in a burial grounds
That only I can find

Winding up the back road hill
Looking for God's acre still
And just when I gave up a headstone was seen
Near the top of the military kill

As I hear the horses drawing close
Over all the corpses we loved most
But I never see them, I never see them
I never see them, I never see them

There's a figure watching from the knoll
All the myths and stories we were told
But I never listen, I never listen
I never listen, I never listen
