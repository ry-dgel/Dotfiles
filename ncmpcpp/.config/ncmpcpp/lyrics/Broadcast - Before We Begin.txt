Here again, at the end
Before the beginning
So the salt will spill again
Throw it over your shoulder

Oh it's in tomorrow
Fortune or sorrow
Wait you may win
I don't mean to show
That I know how this goes
Before we begin again

You may hide on one side
And me on the other
You may speak but wait for me
Should my sentence faulter

Oh it's in tomorrow
Fortune or sorrow
Wait you may win
But now it feels empty
There's no need in guessing
Before we begin again

So here we are again
Back to the beginning
So the salt will spill again
Throw it over your shoulder

Oh it's in tomorrow
Fortune or sorrow
Wait you may win
But now it feels empty
There's no need in guessing
Before we begin again
