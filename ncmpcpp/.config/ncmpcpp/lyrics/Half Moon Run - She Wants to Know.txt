Her face when you've been looking for awhile
Left not a trace that we're underneath the weather
And I tried to let go, and she slipped away
Like a little girl
And I really want to make her mine

My girl would never say what I need to hear
To make it all ok
So we try to make nice and the kids won't know
For a little while
But it really doesn't make it
I find you, alone awhile with a heavy hand and a dark-lit smile
At a fine time to regret what I still don't know
And I really want to make her mine

She wants to know just who I am
She wants to know just who I am
She can make you work for the worth that she has
She wants to know just who I am

I'm guessing that it happens all of the time
Through no fault of mine
But she can turn it around
And she wasn't like the best thing under the sun
But yeah, I guess I needed to learn from her
I guess I need to open up and let it all out!

Your face when it all came down with a bright light
Was a little dark frown
I was unturned by that sharp alarm, and you weren't afraid
But it really doesn't matter
I tried you and forced a smile
And we were like friends for an unsaid while
And I might've let go, maybe one of those nights
She stayed awhile
And still I want to make her mine

She wants to know just who I am
She wants to know just who I am
She can make you work for the worth that she has
She wants to know just who I am

I'm guessing that it happens all of the time
Through no fault of mine
But she can turn it around
And she wasn't like the best thing under the sun
But yeah, I guess I needed to learn from her
I guess I needed to open and let it all out!

And she wasn't like the best thing under the sun
But yeah, I guess I needed to learn from her
I guess I needed to open up and let it all out!
