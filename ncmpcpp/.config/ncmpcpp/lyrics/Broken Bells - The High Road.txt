We’re bound to wait all night
She’s bound to run amuck
Invested enough in it anyhow
And to each his own
The garden is sorting out
She curls her lips on a bow
And I don’t know if you’re dead or not
If you’re anyone
 
C’mon and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many heads to analyze
C’mon and get your overdose
Collect it at the borderline
And they want to get up in your head

Cause they know and so do I
The high road is hard to find
A detour to your new life
Tell all of your friends good bye
 
The dawn to end all nights
That’s all we hoped it was
A break from the warfare in your house
But to each his own
A soldier is bailing out
He curled his lips on a barrel
And I don’t know if the dead can talk
To anyone
 
C’mon and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many hands
Are you one of us
C’mon and get your overdose
Collect it at the borderline
And they want to get up in your head

Cause they know and so do I
The high road is hard to find
A detour to your new life
Tell all of your friends good bye
 
It’s too late to change your mind
You’ve let loss be your guide
It’s too late to change your mind
You’ve let loss be your guide
It’s too late to change your mind
You’ve let loss be your guide
It’s too late to change your mind
You’ve let loss be your guide
