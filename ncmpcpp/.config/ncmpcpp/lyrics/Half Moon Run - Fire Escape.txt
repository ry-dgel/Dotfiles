Hey dark eyes
Rest with me a while as I drift closer to sleep
But still cannot
Still cannot find no peace

You let go of glass at our feet
That rang through the night
You take the fire escape
Run down the street to the church

Hey murderer
The killing keeps us close enough
Hey murderer
Every breath you steal is a breathe I breath for you

You let go of glass at our feet
That rang through the night
You take the fire escape
Run down the street to the church
