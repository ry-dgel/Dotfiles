They all know i'm not your friend
tatus: Unofficial Girl
nd you're not
        
         
         gonna change it are yo?
ou don't want me explode
 
         
Keep convincing me I'm wrong
But I'm not
Gonna Take it

We are doomed, doomed, doomed
This is falling apart
We are doomed, doomed, doomed
You should treat me like a Superstar

ESTRIBILLO
I don't want any lovers
Any love undercover
Let me go, let me go, let me go away
Let me go, let me go, let me go away
I won't play any longer
Second fiddle to no one
Let me go, let me go, let me go away
Let me go, let me go, let me go away

I don't wanna stay the noght
You're not gonna meke it right
And it's time
That say it
You're impervious to all
You look worried, when you're not
And it's time
That I face it

We are doomed, doomed, doomed
This is falling apart
We are doomed, doomed, doomed
You should treat me like a Superstar

ESTRIBILLO

You gotta let me go
I'm strong again
I gotta a move
Find someone else
And call me only when you're sure
I am....
Your superstar

ESTRIBILLO
