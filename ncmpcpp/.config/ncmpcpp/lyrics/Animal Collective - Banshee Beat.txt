Oh, there'll be time to get by
I get dry after the swimming pool
Oh, there'll be time to just cry
Or wonder why it didn't work out
Oh, there'll be time to fish fry
For letters by yours truly
Yours truly

Someone in my dictionary's up to no good
I never find the very special words I should
And so I have another party with a water glass
And I sit on all your actions, it's a birthing game
And I bet he needs a shower 'cause he's just like me
But the soldiers in the painting know your secret face
Well your parrot told me just how I can make you smile
'Gonna let you do your thinkin' if you need a while, but
What I gave you made him get mad
A little bit funny how a thing like that
Could travel through one mouth in through another
And the next thing you know you gotta hear it from your brother
And the words they sting, like a stump of old wasps
Do you remember when I said, "Go throw the rock in there"
And we ran through the woods to our good house?
But you forgot about the things that he could say like
"I don't think that I like you anymore
Well I found new feelings at the feeling store
And I can't find you at our kissing place
Well I'm scared of those new pair of eyes you have," so 

I duck out, go down to find the swimming pool
Hop the fence, leave the street, and wet your feet to find the swimming pool
'Cause when I'd snuffed out I doubt I'd find the swimming pool
Hop the fence, leave the street, and wet your feet to find the swimming pool

But I don't wish that I was dead
Now, a very old friend of mine once said
That either way you look at it
You have your fits, I have my fits but feeling is good
Confusion's not a kidney stone in my brain
If we're miscommunicating, do we feel the same?
'Cause either way you look at it
You have your fits, I have my fits and feeling is good

So I duck out, go down to find the swimming pool
Hop the fence, leave the street, and wet your feet to find the swimming pool
'Cause when I'd snuffed out I doubt I'd find the swimming pool
Hop the fence, leave the street, and wet your feet to find the swimming pool

If you give a little, you can get a little bit
If you give a little, you can get a little bit
If you give a little, you can get a little bit
If you give a little, you can get a little bit
