You know I never want to let you down
It cuts me up to see you sad
And I wish that I could undo what I've done
Give back the faith in me you had

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

You know I love you more than anyone
But I get a little wrapped up in myself
But you know I never want to do you wrong
Bring into question what we have

Oh yeah
I know I let you down
I know I let you down
But you're giving me a chance

Oh yeah
I know I let you down
I know I let you down
But you're giving me a chance
