Under the white chalk 
Drawn on the black board 
Drawn on the black board 
Under the xray 
I'm just a vertebrate 

Do that to me 
Do that to my anatomy 
Do that to me 
Do that to my anatomy 
Corporeal Corporeal 

We are mankind 
We are manikin 
With and without mind 
With or without Darwin 

Classify me 
The strings of my autonomy 
Classify me 
The strings of my autonomy 
Corporeal corporeal 

A thorny red heart 
Around a thin arm 
Inside a white bone 
The love is inborn 

Close up to me 
Up close to my anatomy 
Close up to me 
Up close to my autonomy 
Corporeal corporeal 
Corporeal
