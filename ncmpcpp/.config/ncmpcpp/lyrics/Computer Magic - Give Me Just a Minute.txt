Stay here, see me come undone
Just free my soul and turn me on
Lay me down and stop the time
So long now leave the world behind

We got one minute you know there's no other
It's too late, we're in it, you're blowin' my cover
Take me to heaven and back in a second
Light up this fire before you come rushin'
We got one minute you know there's no other
It's too late, we're in it, you're blowin' my cover
Take me to heaven and back in a second
Light up this fire before you come rushin' (rushin', rushin', rushin'...)

S-s-stop the time
So long now leave the world behind
Got me on the rise, got me got me on the up and up
When I thrash and cry, baby you ain't goin' rough enough
I'm your kitty girl and your back is like my scratchin' post
C'mon make me scream like I like I like I seen a ghost

Drink up, I'm soaked
I'm like the dopest dope you ever smoked
These feelings you evoke I only need one minute till I got you in a stroke

Stay here, see me come undone
Just free my soul and turn me on
Lay me down and stop the time
So long I'll leave the world behind

We got one minute you know there's no other
It's too late, we're in it, you're blowin' my cover
Take me to heaven and back in a second
Light up this fire before you come rushin'
We got one minute you know there's no other
It's too late, we're in it, you're blowin' my cover
Take me to heaven and back in a second
Light up this fire before you come rushin' (rushin', rushin', rushin'...)

S-s-stop the time
So long now leave the world behind
Look into my eyes say you never going to give it up
Try to get my prize it ain't yours until I get enough
Boy I got you sprung you're like when it rains it really pours
Know my body rocks what cha what cha waiting for?

Drink up, I'm soaked
I'm like the dopest dope you ever smoked
These feelings you evoke I only need one minute till I got you in a stroke

Ohh oh oh oh oh ohh oh oh oh oh

We got one minute you know there's no other
It's too late, we're in it, you're blowin' my cover
Take me to heaven and back in a second
Light up this fire before you come rushin'
We got one minute you know there's no other
It's too late, we're in it, you're blowin' my cover
Take me to heaven and back in a second
Light up this fire before you come rushin' (rushin', rushin', rushin'...)
