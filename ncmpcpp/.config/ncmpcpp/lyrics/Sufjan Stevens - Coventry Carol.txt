Lullay, Thou little tiny Child
Bye, bye, lully, lullay
Lullay, Thou little tiny Child
Bye, bye, lully, lullay

O sisters too, how may we do
For to preserve this day
This poor youngling for whom we sing
Bye, bye, lully, lullay

Herod, the king, in his raging
Charged he hath this day
His men of might, in his own sight
All children young, to slay

Lullay, Thou little tiny Child
Bye, bye, lully, lullay
For thy parting neither say nor sing
Bye, bye, lully, lullay
That woe is me, poor Child for Thee!
Bye, bye, lully, lullay
