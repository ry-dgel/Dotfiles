This time you have to walk alone
Don't call me, I blast my nasty phone
I left the place that you go home
I left the place that you go home
Don't you know I died for you
Like the dust in the summer rain

Said you none
Said you none

Don't you know I died for you
Like the dust in the summer rain

Don't you know I cried for you
Like a boy, like the fallen crane

Don't you know I died for you
Like the dust in the summer rain

don't you know i fight for you
like the flame ???

Said you none
Said you none

Don't you know I died for you
Like the dust in the summer rain

Don't you know I cried for you
Like a boy, like a fallen crane

Don't you know I died for you
Like the dust in the summer rain

Don't you know I cried for you
Like a boy like a fallen crane

Don't you know I died for you
Like the dust in the summer rain

don't you know i fight for you
like the flame ???

Said you none

Don't you know i died for you
Like the dust in the summer rain
