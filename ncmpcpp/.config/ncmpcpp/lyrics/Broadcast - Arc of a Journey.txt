Clouds float away like iron tools on the moon
All my time is in half life
Memories over memories
Can I see more than I'm programmed to be

Constellation of orion
A picture with a past, a future so vast
A mnemonic game on the arc of a journey

I report there once were cities
Open academies, avenues and tree
Human law, automatic oracles
Calender, the years, verbal hemispheres

Constellation of orion
The repositioned light, the post atomic night
Informing me I'm near the axis of feeling
Constellation of orion
A picture with a past, a future so vast
A mnemonic game on the arc of a journey
