Raised in them streets where them niggas tow heat
 911 can't save nobody RIP widit but we don't smoke Bobby 
nly one rule don't trust nobody
         
           Truck got kicks like the bass no karate
I love the tattoos all over my body 
Getting money my favorite hobby
Went to sleep in the hood woke up in the lobby
In another country got the munchies
All these bad bitches call me PÃ¡pi
Chulo I keep a few hoes don't trust these niggas like groupie hoes
Hating on a nigga cause I'm on my grind
Weed and dollar signs on my mind
If you ain't on your grind nigga that should be a crime 
Fuck police nigga fuck one time
If I fuck one time I can fuck two times
But I ain't worried bout you, I'm worried bout loot
I'm tryna have this 4 door and a coupe
I'm talking uncle screws money to the roof
Trap on your crew this what it do
Holla hooty hoo shoutout schoolboy
We both grew up on the big side where the young niggas let the bullets fly 
Kush so loud what I smoke so strong 
Damn lil mamma why you blowing up my phone
Heard your boyfriend tripping put the  chrome to his dome
Now he gone and that's a favor cause he a hater I'm getting paper
But I still ride around In a scraper
Lowkey truck got keys like piano
I am Young Sam a soprano
I'm feeling like tony Montana I come from where niggas rob Santa
I'm feeling like tony Montana I come from where niggas rob Santa
Bass so loud you can hear me coming 
I'm the big bad wolf huffin and puffin
Trap ?? Is a word I made now the whole world know about it
That shit crazy , Nigga that shit crazy, I said that shit crazy
