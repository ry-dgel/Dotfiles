If sound is a wave like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violin
Pushing and pulling from shore to shore
Biggest melody you never heard before
What if I were the night sky
Here's my lullaby to leave by

What if we hadn't been born at the same time
What if you were 75 and I were 9
Would I come visit you
Bring you cookies in an old folks home
Would you be there alone
And when the late summer lightning fires off in your arms will I remember to breathe no I never will
And if I could convince you that I mean you no harm
Just want to show you how not to need
What if I were the night sky
Here's my lullaby to leave by

What if we hadn't been each other at the same time
Would you tell me all the stories from when you were young and in your prime
Would I rock you to sleep
Would you tell all the secrets you don't need to keep
Would I still miss you
Or would you then have been mine
If sound is a wave like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violin
