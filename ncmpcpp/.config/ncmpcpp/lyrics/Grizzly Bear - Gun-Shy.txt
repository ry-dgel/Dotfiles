The sky keeps staring at me
Frozen in my tracks
Nothing else to see
And when I move my face left
You're always standing there
A shadow I can't see
And even then I can't trace
You're walking away

I put my ears to the ground
Always pushing down
Nothing I can hear
I found the worst half in me
I'm cut off at the knees
Can't even take a stand
Against your words and beliefs
We didn't want to freeze

(All of the years
Leaving me here
Gun-shy
The pain
Losing my aim
And why
Haven't we changed?
Story to blame?
Recite
All of my wrongs
You know it's wrong
You smile)

I don't want to say it all again
I never seem to see
And why?
Do I always feel it all the same
The blisters in my eyes
Recite
A guide that has only led me stray
And even as I limp
You smile

The cold keeps tearing at me
Slowing down my blood
Unable to speak
I left my mind long ago
Choosing something false
Always letting go
And when I try to face you
You're walking away
