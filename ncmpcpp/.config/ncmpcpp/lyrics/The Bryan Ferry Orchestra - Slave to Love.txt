Tell her I'll be waiting in the usual place
With the tired and weary and there's no escape
To need a woman you've got to know
How the strong get weak and the rich get poor

Slave to love
Oho
Slave to love

You're running with me
Don't touch the ground
We're the restless hearted
Not the chained and bound

The sky is burning
A sea of flame
Though your world is changing
I will be the same

Slave to love
Oho
Slave to love

Slave to love (Nananana)
Oho (Nananana)
Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

The storm is breaking or so it seems
We're too young to reason, too grown up to dream
Now spring is turning your face to mine
I can hear your laughter, I can see your smile

Slave to love (Nananana)
Oho (Nananana)
Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

Slave to love (Nananana)
Oho (Nananana)
Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

(Nananana)
(Nananana)
Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

(Nananana)
(Nananana)
Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

(Nananana)
(Nananana)
Slave to love
I can't escape
I'm a slave to love
