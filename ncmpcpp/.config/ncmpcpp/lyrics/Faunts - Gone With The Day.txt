All I have is gone
Let me in and I'll take you away
Tonight I'm all alone
I know the chance is gone with the day
I know the chance is gone with the day
I cry, help me, I'm afraid
Help me, I'm afraid, she's gone
I try to hold the love with me
To hold the love with me, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
I'm alone
With the night

Stars are out tonight
Light the dark in a heart that is cold
Heal the love and fate
And all the days that I'm alone
And all the days that I'm alone

I cry, help me, I'm afraid
Help me, I'm afraid, she's gone
I try to hold the love with me
To hold the love with me, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
I'm alone

All I have is gone
Let me in and take me away
Tonight I'm all alone
I know the chance is gone with the day
I know the chance is gone with the day
I know the chance is gone with the day
I know the chance is gone with the day
