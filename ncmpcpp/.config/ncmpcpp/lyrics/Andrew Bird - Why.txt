Why? Why'd you do that?
You shouldn't have done that
If I told you once, I told you three times
That you'll get your punishment when you
Show me your crimes
  
And it's not a spell or a curse you put on me
Or the way you make me smile so tenderly
How I wish it was your temper you were throwing
Damn you for being so easygoing
  
I thought the time would tell
My sins would provoke you
To raise, raise some hell, oh...
  
Not a chance
Whatever happened to fiery romance
How I wish it was your dishes you were throwing
Damn you for being so easygoing
  
Why? Why'd you do that?
Why'd I do what, huh?
Nothing. You get it? What? Nothing.
  
I thought the time would tell
My sins would provoke you
To raise, raise some hell, oh...
  
Don't give me that line
Don't try to tell me inaction is not a crime
Can't you see what kind of seeds you're sowing?
Damn you for being so easygoing
