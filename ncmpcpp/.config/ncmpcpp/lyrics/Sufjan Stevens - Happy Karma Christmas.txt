Would it have been best to forget you
Would it have been better for me
And if I could write off your intentions
Would you pretend you don't love me

And I wish you a happy karma Christmas
And I miss you my happy karma girl
My karma girl

Sometimes I think I'm just a phantom
Loneliness grows deep within me
I gave you love, I gave you fortune
Still you insist you don't love me

And I wish you a happy karma Christmas
And I miss you my happy karma girl
And I wish you a happy karma Christmas
And I miss you my happy karma girl
My karma girl
