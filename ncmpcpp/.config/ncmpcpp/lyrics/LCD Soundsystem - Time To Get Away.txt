It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you, uh

You brought a lot of money
But me, I've got a tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep, I try and try
But you’re undermine me, uh huh
And I start to be sensible (if you know what I mean)

And so it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I’m dying to get away
I’m dying to get away

And next time we’ll talk it over
And we can start again

For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
A-what what what what what did you think would happen next?
A-what what what what what could it ever be?

Though it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I’m dying to get away
I’m dying to get away

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Next time let’s talk about it
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Or maybe start again

Shock, to think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it’s true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it’s true

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Next time we can talk about it
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Or even start again
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
I couldn’t tell you what you wanted
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
You know what I’m saying?
I knew you were low man
But the truth is I was shocked

[Of] power eyes, eyes never lie
Kids, Kids never lie
