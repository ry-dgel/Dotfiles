The first time I ran away I saw faces in the trees
I heard voices in the stormy sea, ooh
(by the waterfall)

The second time I ran away I saw warriors on the train
catching tigers by the tail
They sang ooh

'Cause the way they look at you as if you were a stranger
The way they talk to you as if you were a child
(by the waterfall)

The last time I run away, well I hope it is with you
Will you let me show you where to run?
(by the waterfall)
