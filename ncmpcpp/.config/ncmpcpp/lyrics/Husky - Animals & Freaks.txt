Hey man, do you wanna hear a story about me?
I'm an old man, you're probably not interested I see
But I'll tell you anyway, about the girl who came to stay
Thirty years, six months and two days ago

She walked into the party
With Joan de Monmarquis
She wore her beauty like a cloak
With the devil up her sleeve

And she was ancient like the Greeks
Amongst us animals and freaks
I lost my mind, never to find
The useless thing again

There was something going on that night
But I don't know what it was
There was something going on that night
I was waiting, we were just waiting for it

I forgot everything I knew
In the ancient sea that night
When she slipped her dress off
Shivering and clung to me so tight

Then she whispered in my ear
"There is nowhere else but here"
Nowhere, nowhere

There was something going on that night
But I don't know what it was
There was something going on that night
I was waiting, we were just waiting

You don't know yourself
You don't know yourself
You don't know yourself
Until she's had her way with you

We spent three weeks in a cheap hotel
Corroding by the sea
Tangled up in sheets and love
And ancient misery

One day I woke to see her leave
She had an eagle on her sleeve
The last I heard she took the bird
To catch snakes in Mexico

There was something going on that night
But I don't know what it was
There was something going on that night
I was waiting, we were just waiting for it
