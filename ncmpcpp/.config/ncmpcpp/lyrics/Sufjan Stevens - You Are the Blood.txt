You are the blood flowing through my fingers
All through the soil and up in those trees

You are electricity and you're light
You are sound itself and you are flight

You are the blood flowing through my fingers
All through the soil and up in those trees
You are electricity and you're light
You are sound itself and you are flight
You are the blood flowing through my fingers
All through the soil and up in those trees

You are the blood flowing through my fingers

You are the blood that I may see you
That I may see you
You are the blood in me
You are the earth on which I travel
On which I travel
You are the earth under my feet
That I may travel
That I may travel with you
You are the earth on which I write the circumstances
You say what you want from me
You are the solitude that goes against me
That goes against me
You are the quiet
In which I dream, in which I sleep, in which I wander
