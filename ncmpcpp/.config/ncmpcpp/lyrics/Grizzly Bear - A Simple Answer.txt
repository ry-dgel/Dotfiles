Those saints in lockstep
All crossed the wasteland
Forever gone
They'll hum and walk along

Plod ever onward
Across some tundra
The light is long
But it's not long before it's gone
Well fine

And it calls you back to mind
At once
At last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please not so long this time

Too young and thoughtless
To calm your memories
I know it's wrong
Just give until it's gone

Some tired mantra
Calls ever onward
Shout it loud
Just make it up somehow
Well alright

And it'll call you back to mind
At once
At last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please not so long
This time

Move on let's face
That all you trust is a cynical phrase
No time no place
When all you hope is that everything breaks
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No bliss no light
Tell me it's all just a lie
You can't scare me none
I'm still the lucky one
