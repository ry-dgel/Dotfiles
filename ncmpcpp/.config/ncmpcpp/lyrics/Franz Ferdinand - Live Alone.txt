I want to live alone
Because the greatest love 
Is always ruined by the bickering
The argument of living
I want to live alone
I could be happy on my own

Live the rest of my life
With the vaguest of feeling

I... 

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here, I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here, I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

And so I'm going to live alone
I'm not sayin' that our love is the greatest
But I'm in love with you
Want to stay in love with you
So I'm going to live alone
Yeah, I'll be happy on my own

Live the rest of the life
With the vaguest of feeling

I...

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here, I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

In New York City, 
when I get in a taxi
I say "Man" to the driver so
He'll say
"Man! I can imagine
having a drink with that guy"

He's alright
Oh, he's alright
He's alright
Yeah, he's alright
He's alright

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here, I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here, I'll be here
Wishing I could be there
