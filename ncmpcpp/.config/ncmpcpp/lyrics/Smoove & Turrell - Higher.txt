Your patter doesn't really matter
Do you think that you own this crowd
You got your little grown look
Plastic talk to boot
Been everywhere that is your sound
Behind your little red robe
Trying hard to gloat but you can't
With your so called friends and their empty hands
Phone full of numbers
But nobody wants to call y' come on

Cause you're higher than yourself, oh yeah
You think that all of this matters, they're total backstabbers
Look around at who you've become
You're getting higher to protect yourself, oh yeah
And it don't mean nothing, silly fools they'll all be laughing
To the same, to the same old hell

A personality broker
Suck them in so they can choke ya
Do you think that you fool this crowd?
You're killing all imagination
Man it's your own creation
Worst of all you're smug and proud
Behind your little glass screen
Trying hard to breath but you can't
Cause things come round the corner, better watch your back stalker
Got a phone full of numbers
But you've been cut off by your brothers, come on

Cause you're higher than yourself, oh yeah
You think that all of this matters, they're total backstabbers
Look around at who you've become
You're getting higher to protect yourself, oh yeah
And it don't mean nothing, silly fools they'll all be laughing
To the same, to the same old hell
