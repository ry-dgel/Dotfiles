Said the voice from afar
"Don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?"
Waiting for everyone else around to agree might take too long
Might take too long
Then it won't be so hard (It won't be so hard)

Well it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from our dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh, alter ego

Get them to love you
While they may depending on your heart and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else, nobody else

If I could part
It wouldn't be so hard (It won't be so hard)

Well it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from our dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh, alter ego
