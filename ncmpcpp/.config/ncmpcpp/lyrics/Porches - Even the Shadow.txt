Even in the shadows
I turn around
To find you walk away
And even when I whisper
The winds will come
To steal the words I say

I could fall and keep on falling
I could call and keep on calling
Wonder why this love is over
Wonder why it’s not forever

Even in the silence
I hear my heart
It’s still a part of you
And even in the morning
When light has come
I don’t know what to do

I could fall and keep on falling
I could call and keep on calling
Wonder why this love is over
Wonder why it’s not forever

So high, so low
Love is gone and love is gone…
