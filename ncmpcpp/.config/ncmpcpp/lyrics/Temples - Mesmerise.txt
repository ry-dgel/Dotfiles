Mesmerise, analyze
Everything that you need
Make the choice with the words
Speak and then tuck away

Seize till never, reach from within
Decide to shine a leg of you
Seems out of pleasure, shine like a gentleman
Then serenade of you

Tears fell upon the fire
Fell upon desire
Early in the morning
Age learning to deceive
Sunset of the east
You and I alone

Paradise is alive
In the countries I've bred
Shake away and become
From an hour of the day

Piece of the passage lay down before me
Guns and carousel are true
Seems our pleasure, shine like a gentleman
Beneath the ever-changing view

Tears fell upon the fire
Fell upon desire
Early in the morning
Age learning to deceive
Sunset of the east
You and I alone

Do you see what you feel at the end of the day?
You go on
Lead the way
I'mma wash you, wash you away
In our hearts beat, in our hearts beach

Tears fell upon the fire
Fell upon desire
Early in the morning
Age learning to deceive
Sunset of the east
You and I alone

Tears fell upon the fire
Fell upon desire
Early in the morning
Age learning to deceive
Sunset of the east
You and I alone
