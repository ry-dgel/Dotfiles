Bring a torch
Jeanette, Isabelle
Bring a torch
Come swiftly and run

Christ is born
Tell the folk of the village
Jesus is sleeping
In his cradle

Ah, ah
Beatiful is the mother
Ah, ah
Beatiful is her Son

Hasten now
Good folk of the village
Hasten now
The Christ child to see

You will find him
Asleep in the manger
Quietly come
Whisper softly

Hush, hush
Peacefully now he slumbers
Hush, hush
Peacefully now he sleeps
