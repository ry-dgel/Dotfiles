This dog got bit on a leg
He got a really big chip on a leg
Don't want to get out of bed
Unless he feel like it justified

Here comes the loaf again
Drip a lot, drop a lot
Become an oaf again
Trip a lot, trip a lot
So wide to the other side
Shuts an eye
But he stays like a stump inside
Hey, hey, hey

Upon the gusts he glide
Brittle mind, gentle mind
Toward a bigger sign
Every time, every time
So much for the safest vibe
Tossed aside
But he burns like a blaze inside
Hey, hey, hey
