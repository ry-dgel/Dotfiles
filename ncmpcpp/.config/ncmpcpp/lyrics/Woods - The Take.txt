All you've seen the days let goIn summer breeze and wind-wept snowSeasons change as we grow old

A sip of light, you'll surely know

Get lost in each other
Get lost with it all
We take peace from another
Oh, bury it all

[?] leaves that fly in sky
You welcome day, hello sunshine
Riverbend and river blind
We take the take, we borrow time

(Get lost in each other)
(Get lost with it all)
(We take peace from another)
(Oh, bury it all)
(Get lost in each other)
(Get lost with it all)
