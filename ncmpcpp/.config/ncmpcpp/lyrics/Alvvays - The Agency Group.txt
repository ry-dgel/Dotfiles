parked outside of the agency
wondering if you can't sneak away with me
I'll admit I've been losing sleep
rifling through your toxicology
when you whisper you don't think of me that way
when I mention you don't mean that much to me
to me
an outcast of modern society
suffering from a case of sobriety
shortcomings, well you can take your pick
when you are catering to one of your nervous ticks
when you whisper you don't think of me that way
when I mention you don't mean that much to me
to me, to me
you know that it won't take much longer
before it's wrong
you know that it won't take much longer
now that I'll be gone
it's gone
the sun
it's gone
when you whisper you don't think of me that way
when I mention you don't mean that much to me
when you whisper you don't think of me that way
when I mention you don't mean that much to me
to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me
