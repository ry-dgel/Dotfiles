Walking through dark streets,the cold is looking for some way to stroke my skin.My body is shaking, my knees are weak,          
           intense emotions overflowing me

I try to find myself, I try to move on,
dont know where I am, please carry me home
I try to find myself,
I try to move on, dont know where I am,
please carry me home

But I tell you whats inside of me will never die,will never die

I try to find myself, I try to move on,
dont know where I am, please carry me home
