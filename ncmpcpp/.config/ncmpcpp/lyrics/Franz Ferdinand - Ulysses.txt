Well, I sit and hear sentimental footsteps
And then a voice say "Hi, so?
So what you got? What you got this time?
Come on, let's get high
Come on, Lexxo, what you got next-o?
Walking 25 miles-o?
Well, I'm bored, I'm bored
C'mon, let's get high

Come on, let's get high
Come on, let's get high
High"

Well, I found a new way
I found a new way
Come on, don't amuse me
I don't need your sympathy
La, la la la la
Ulysses
I'll find a new way
I'll find a new way, baby

Am I Ulysses? Am I Ulysses?
No, but you are now, boy
So sinister, so sinister
But last night was wild

What's the matter there?
Feeling kinda anxious?
That hot blood grow cold?
Yeah, everyone, everybody knows it
Yeah, everyone, everybody know it
Everybody knows I

La, la la la la
Ulysses
I'll find a new way
I Ill find a new way, baby

La, la la la la
Ulysses
I'll find a new way
Well, I'll find a new way, baby

Oh
Oh, then suddenly you know
You're never going home
You're never, you're never
You're never, you're never
You're never, you're never
You're never going home

I'm not Ulysses, aw, baby, no
La la la la, wooh
You're not Ulysses, wooh
La la la la, wooh
