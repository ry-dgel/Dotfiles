And she was lying in the grass
And she could hear the highway breathing
And she could see a nearby factory
She's making sure she is not dreaming
See the lights of a neighbor's house
Now, she's starting to rise
Take a minute to concentrate
And she opens up her eyes

The world was moving, she was right there with it, and she was
The world was moving, she was floating above it, and she was
And she was

And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the Earth
Moving into the universe, and she's
Drifting this way and that
Not touching the ground at all, and she's
Up above the yard

The world was moving, she was right there with it, and she was
The world was moving, she was floating above it, and she was

She was glad about it, no doubt about it
She isn't sure about what she's done
No time to think about what to tell them
No time to think about what she's done
And she was, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She's moving out in all directions

The world was moving, she was right there with it, and she was
The world was moving, she was floating above it, and she was, hey, hey
Joining the world of missing persons, and she was, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Missing enough to feel alright, and she was
And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was
