Wait for the sun to get up in the morning
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooo
It's a beautiful day but I'm waiting for someone
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooo
I ain't got no time to be broken-hearted
No, it's time for me to get my life started
Wait for the sun to get up in the morning
Waiting for you

Love is a drug
Oh no I'm waiting
And sometimes it sucks
It's so fucking frustrating
Love is a drug
Oh God I'm waiting
I'm waiting for you to come home

You make me rock tight
You make me rock right
I rock to the sound of the beat tonight
The blood is my weapon of the love I feel
It's go your face I need and the cream I feel
I got four fans and the band's going wild
But girl you got me like hooked
I ain't got no time to be broken-hearted
No, it's time for me to get my life started
Again I can't take it so I break and fall
You hang from a rope 'til it all just paused
Death from the start, a stab in the heart
I'm addicted to you
