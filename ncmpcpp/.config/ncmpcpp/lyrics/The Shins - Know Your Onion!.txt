Shut out, pimpled and angry
I quietly tied all my guts into knots
Gave up on trying to make 'em
I figured it'd take 'em too long to look up and besides

It was undeniably clear to me
I don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we've always been

Lucked out, found my favorite record
Lying in wait at the Birmingham Mall
The songs that I heard, the occasional book were the only fun I ever took
And I got on with making myself

The trick is just making yourself
But when they're parking their cars on your chest 
You've still got a view of the summer sky
To make it hurt twice when your restless body caves to its whims
And suddenly struggles to take flight

Three thousand miles northeast
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop shaking their heads
"What kind of life do you dream of? You're allergic to love!"
Yes, I know but I must say in my own defense

It's been undeniably dear to me, I don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we are, the selfless, loving saints we are
The melting, sliding dice we've always been
