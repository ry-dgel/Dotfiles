These streets are crowded with cowards disguised as men.
They are paying no consequence for their actions, 
So we'll all give in.

I say the same things
Over and over and over again,
But you act like you've never heard them.
We were created to set an example.
So what is this, what is this?

This is the same old story,
This is the same old scene.
We're living our lives right out of a magazine,
I guess we'll never know!

Have we gone from little to less,
To nothing at all, nothing at all?
It seems like every soul
Has been sold for a dollar or less.
So I guess we'll never know
How good it could have been.
How good it could have been!

Savor every breath
That enters your lungs,
I promise it won't last forever.
And by the time you realize
You were wrong, you'll be far gone.

Savor every breath
That enters your lungs,
I promise it won't last forever.
And by the time you realize
You were wrong, you'll be far gone!

Follow me or back out now.
Follow me with all your heart
Or back out, back out now!

We all swim in a sea of pride,
Where character is rare.
(Where character is rare)
With every passing day,
It only gets worse
And no one seems to care.

We all die wondering what if I-
What if I would have tried?
And while you're begging for life on you knees,
You'll realize you were never happy!

Have we gone from little to less,
To nothing at all, nothing at all?
It seems like every soul
Has been sold for a dollar or less.
I guess we'll never know
How good it could have been.

The clouds begin to move in rhythm,
There is a storm in the sky.

I will cause a disaster,
Create an earthquake
And watch as you shake.
I will cause a disaster,
Watch as you shake!

We all die wondering what if I-
What if I would have tried?
What if I would have tried?

I guess we'll never know!

It seems like every soul
Has been sold for a dollar or less.
I guess we'll never know
How good it could have been.
How good it could have been!
