Thought I was falling into a deep depression
Thinking all the mystery was all gone
Like I was falling into the deep of a grand canyon
From the side of a mountain I was hanging on

But now I'm coming up for air
I see my angel on the sand
She's running out to meet me
In the waves of the of the Rio Grande

And it's joy, honey, pure joy uh huh
Pure joy just to see you again

I thought my heart was in a rut of recession
All the colors I had seen had faded into the black
Like I was falling fast to the bottom of the ocean
And just my luck my hands were all chained up behind my back

But now I'm coming up for air
I see my angel on the sand
She's running out to meet me
To save me again

And it's joy, honey, pure joy uh huh
Pure joy just to see you again

And it's joy, honey, pure joy
To see the sun coming down through the mist

Yeah it's joy, honey, pure joy
To feel the medicine of oxygen fill up my lungs like this

And it's joy, honey, pure joy
To feel the strength of your kiss against my lips

Yeah it's joy, honey pure joy
Ain't no other way to say just what this feeling is

Pure joy
Pure joy
Pure joy
