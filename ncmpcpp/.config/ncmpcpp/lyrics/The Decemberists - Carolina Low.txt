I am a boy from the high country
And I got a little love for the offering
I come down from the mountain, bow to the sea
And Carolina low I will carry thee

Gonna take you up, gonna take you around
Oh, your poor little pant legs, all dragging down
Did you crack your lip? Did you skin your knee?
And Carolina low I will carry thee

What is sealed with a handshake is spoiled with a kiss
You got an ugly little mouth, boy, and it's come to this
I'm bound for the hilltop, gonna make it bleed
And Carolina low I will carry thee

I am a boy from the high country
And I got a little love for the offering
And I got a little love for the offering
And I got a little love for the offering
