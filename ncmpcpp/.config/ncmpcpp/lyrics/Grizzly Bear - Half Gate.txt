Past the roaring shore
I have nothing left to hear
I'm chasing all the words
But everything you say I only see

But honestly it's fine
When I mention how I love you
It's all I do
Even as I stray

We have the cold to keep
I'm not sure I still believe
My most is nothing more
Than a place we've been before

We'll draw and drag it on
I'm telling you I'm trying to hear this out
I want nothing more to doubt
A little bit of shame

Which of yourselves is truly gone?
And checked out so long
Unhinged unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there still as you were

At the end of the line
It's as if there's no time at all
Nothing to left to win
Every pleasure burned to the wick
Content to be alone
A quiet picture drawn each day before it ends
To remind me once again
Why I'm even here

Which of yourselves is truly gone?
Checked out so long
Unhinged unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there still as you were
