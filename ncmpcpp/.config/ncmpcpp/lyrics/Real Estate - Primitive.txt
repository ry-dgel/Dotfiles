When the night is young in the land I'm from,
The seasons ghost away
The stars at night, obscured by light
can still lead me through this

Don't know where I want to be,
But I'm glad that you're with me,
And all I know is it'd be easy to leave

And in my mind I can see the street
where you and I will live
You still can't see the stars at night
But we're not primitive

Don't know where I want to be,
Oh, but I'm glad that you're with me,
And all I know is it'd be easy to leave
