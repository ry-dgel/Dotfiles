Config files for my Linux desktop. Mainly using BSPWM on arch, with zsh being the shell, neovim as an editor, and mpd/ncmpcpp being the main music player

Some configs depend on scripts found in my Script repository.

Repo made using stow, so directory tree acts as if root git directory is user home directory.
